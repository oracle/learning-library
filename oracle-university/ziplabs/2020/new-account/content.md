## Before You Begin ##
This 5-minute lab walks you through the steps of getting an Oracle Cloud Free Tier account and signing in.

### Background ###
Thanks for dropping by the Oracle University Zip Labs! All Zip Labs are less than 20 minutes. They're  designed to build your familiarity with the Oracle Cloud using step-by-step instructions. You need an Oracle Cloud account to complete the Zip Labs. If you don't have one, follow these steps to get a free tier account. 

These labs mostly focus on Autonomous Data Warehouse and Autonomous Transaction Processing. But there's even more you can do with the Oracle Cloud! This includes building production-ready workloads by using a variety of cloud services including Database, Compute, IoT, API Management, Integration, and Digital Assistant!
