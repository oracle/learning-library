## Overview

Terraform is Infrastructure as Code tool for building and managing infrastructure efficiently and elegantly. In this lab we will use pre-configured terraform scripts to deploy VCN, Compute Instance, Block storage and attach the block storage to compute instance without using OCI console. We will then delete all these infrastructure resources.

4. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```

and then 

```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command  
```
cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

, highlight the key and copy

14. Verify opc@<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME> appears on the prompt

## Configure OCI CLI Install Terraform Upload API keys and verify functionality

1. Check oci CLI installed version, Enter command:
```
oci -v
```
**NOTE:** Version should be minimum 2.5.X (3/23/2019)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_CLI/img/100_CLI_001.png" alt="image-alt-text">

2. Next we will configure OCI CLI. Enter command:
```
oci setup config
```

3. Accept the default location. For user OCI switch to OCI Console window. Click Human Icon and then your user name. In the user details page Click **copy** to copy the OCID. **Also note down your region name as shown in OCI Console window**. Paste the OCID in ssh session.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/img/Stream_004.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

4. Repeat the step to find tenancy OCID (Human icon followed by Clicking Tenancy Name). Paste the Tenancy OCID in ssh session to compute instance followed by providing your region name (us-ashburn-1, us-phoneix-1 etc)

5. When asked for **Do you want to generate a new RSA key pair?** answer Y. For the rest of the question accept default by pressing Enter

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/img/Stream_005.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

6. **oci setup config** also generated an API key. We will need to upload this API key into our OCI account for authentication of API calls. Switch to ssh session to compute instance, to display the conent of API key Enter command :

```
cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
```

7. Hightligh and copy the content from ssh session. Switch to OCI Console, Click Human icon followed by your user name. In user details page Click **Add Public Key**. In the dialg box paste the public key content and Click **Add**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/img/Stream_007.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

8. Next, Download script to install Terraform, Enter command:
```
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Infra_Using_Terraform/tf_setup.sh -o tf_setup.sh
```

This will download a script file called **tf_setup.sh**

9. Next modify the permission on the script and execute it, Enter Commands:
```
sudo chmod 755 tf_setup.sh
```

```
./tf_setup.sh
```

Press **Enter** when prompted

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Infra_Using_Terraform/img/Terraform_002.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

10. The script will install needed packages and create a new directory **tflab**. We will need to modify some env variables in the file. Enter command:
```
cd tflab
```

11. Now edit the env-variables file. We will updated 2 variables. Enter command:
```
vi env-vars
```

**NOTE: You can use another editor such as nano as well**

12. Update the TF_VAR_user_ocid variable with User OCID saved earlier

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Infra_Using_Terraform/img/Terraform_005.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

13. Next Update the TF_VAR_Compartment_ocid variable. Switch to OCI Console window, Click **Compartment** under **Identity**. Locate your compartment name and Click it. In the compartment details page , clik **copy** to copy the OCID
Paste this OCID in **env-vars** file

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Infra_Using_Terraform/img/Terraform_006.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Infra_Using_Terraform/img/Terraform_007.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

14. After updating env-vars file the content will look like below;

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Infra_Using_Terraform/img/Terraform_008.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

15. Save the file and then source it, Etner command:
```
source env-vars
```

16. The enviornment is now set. Next we will download a terraform file (.tf) file that will be used to create VCN, Compute instnace, block volume and attach block volume to compute instance. We will download this file in **/home/opc** directory, Enter Command:
```
cd /home/opc
```

Enter Command: 

```
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Infra_Using_Terraform/compute.tf -o compute.tf
```

17. Ensure you are in **/home/opc** directory. 

18. Now initialize terraform , Enter Command:
```
terraform init
```

Verify successful initialization

19. To see the deloyment plan, Enter Command:
```
terraform plan
```

This will provide details on what will be configured in OCI

20. Finally apply the plan to create the infrastructure, Enter Command:
```
terraform apply
```

**NOTE:** You must type **yes** when prompted

21. This script will take some time to execute. You can switch to OCI console and observe creation of VCN, Compute instance, Block Volume and attachment of block volume to the compute instance.

22. Finally, destroty the infrastrucutre that we created. Enter Command:
```
terraform destroy
```

**NOTE:** You must type **yes** when prompted

You can switch to OCI console and observe deletion of VCN, Compute instance, Block Volume

**Congratulations! You have successfully completed the lab**
