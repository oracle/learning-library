## Overview

In this lab we will create a compute instance, download a script to configure streaming service, publish and consume messages.The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming service provides a fully managed, scalable, and durable storage solution for ingesting continuous, high-volume streams of data that you can consume and process in real time. Streaming can be used for messaging, ingesting high-volume data such as application logs, operational telemetry, web Click-stream data, or other use cases in which data is produced and processed continually and sequentially in a publish-subscribe messaging model.

4. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```
and then 
```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command  
```
cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
 , highlight the key and copy

10. Wait for Instance to be in **Running** state. In git-bash Enter Command:
```
 cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh
```
11. Enter **ls** and verify id_rsa file exists

12. Enter command 
```
ssh -i id_rsa_user opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>

14. Verify opc@<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME> appears on the prompt

## Download Script to configure Streaming service and Publish messages

1. In ssh session to compute instance, configure OCI CLI, Enter command:

```
oci setup config
```

2. Accept the default directory location. For user OCI switch to OCI Console window. Click Human Icon and then your user name. In the user details page Click **copy** to copy the OCID. **Also note down your region name as shown in OCI Console window**. Paste the OCID in ssh session.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/img/Stream_004.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

3. Repeat the step to find tenancy OCID (Human icon followed by Clicking Tenancy Name). Paste the Tenancy OCID in ssh session to compute instance followe by providing your region name (us-ashburn-1, us-phoneix-1 etc)

4. When asked for **Do you want to generate a new RSA key pair?** answer Y. For the rest of the question accept default by pressing Enter

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/img/Stream_005.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

5. **oci setup config** also generated an API key. We will need to upload this API key into our OCI account for authentication of API calls. Switch to ssh session to compute instance, to display the conent of API key Enter command :

```
cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
```

6. Hightligh and copy the content from ssh session. Switch to OCI Console, Click Human icon followe by your user name. In user details page Click **Add Public Key**. In the dialg box paste the public key content and Click **Add**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/img/Stream_007.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

7. Download and Install pip utility which will be used to install additional software. Enter command:

```
sudo curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

followed by

```
sudo python get-pip.py

```

8. Install a virtual enviornement. This is being done so we have a clean enviornment to execute our python script that will create and publish messages to OCI streaming service. Enter command:

```
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

9. Now create a virtual enviornment, Enter command:

```
virtualenv <Enviornment_Name>
```
For example **virtualenv stream_env**

Now initialize the virtual enviornment, Enter command:

**NOTE** : Below command assumes that the enviornment name is 'stream-env'
```
source ~/stream_env/bin/activate
```

10. Once your virtual environment is active, oci can be installed using pip, Enter command:

```
pip install oci
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/img/Stream_008.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

11. Now download the main script file though first we will remove the existing file, Enter Command:

```
cd /home/opc
```
```
rm stream_example.py
```
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/stream_example.py
```

12. Now download a dependent script file though first we will remove the existing file, Enter Command:

```
cd /home/opc/stream_env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/oci/streaming/
```
```
rm stream_admin_client_composite_operations.py
```
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/stream_admin_client_composite_operations.py
```

13. Our setup is now ready. Before running the script switch to OCI Console window, from the main menu Click **Compartments** under **Identity**. Click your compartment name and copy the OCID of the compartment. (Just as was done for user OCID earlier)

14. Switch to ssh session and run the script, Enter command:

```
python ~/stream_example.py <COMPARTMENT_OCID>
```

For example : 

python ~/stream_example.py ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaada2gaukcqoagqoshxq2pyt6cdsj2mhnrz3p5nke33ljx2bp476wq

15. Follow the prompts of the script. The script will create Streaming service called **SdkExampleStream**. It will publish 100 messages, create 2 groups on the compute and read those messages. Finally it will delete the streaming service. **You will be prompted to hit enter after verifying each step**

## Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click **Instances** under **Compute**

3. Locate compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminat**

4. Make sure Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume is checked, Click Terminate Instance. Wait for instance to fully Terminate

5. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will 
appear.

6. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Delete All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted
