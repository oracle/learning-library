# Data Science Project Setup

## Introduction

Projects are used to collect related data science resources and artifact, such that it enables you to organize your work. They contain a collection of notebook sessions and models.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 5 minutes

### Objective
In this lab, you:
* Use the Console to create a Data Science Project.

### Prerequisites

* A tenancy that is configured to work with the Data Science service.
* An account that has permission to create a Data Science project.

## **Step 1:** Creating a Project

You create a Data Science project to organize your notebook sessions and models within your project.

1. Open the [My Reservations](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/my-reservations) page.
1. On the [My Reservations](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/my-reservations) page click on **Launch Workshop**. If you have multiple workshops list, make sure that you click on the one for this lab.
1. Note the name of the compartment. It generally has the format ``LL####-COMPARTMENT`` where ``####`` is a number.
1. [Login to the OCI Console](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html).
1. Open the navigation menu.
1. Under **Data and AI**, select **Data Sciences**, and then click **Projects**.
1. Select the compartment that you noted previously. Generally, you will need to expand (click the + symbol) the ``root`` and ``Livelabs`` sections.
1. Click **Create Project**.
1. (Optional, but recommended) Enter a unique name (255 character limit) for the project. If you don't provide a name, a name is automatically generated for you. For example, ``datascienceproject20200108222435``.
1. (Optional, but recommended) Enter a description (400 character limit) for the project. If you don't add a description, it remains empty.
1. (Optional) Add tags to easily locate and track the project by selecting a tag namespace, then entering the key and value. To add more than one tag, click **+Additional Tags**. [Tagging](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm) describes the various tags that you can use organize and find projects including [cost-tracking tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Tagging/Tasks/usingcosttrackingtags.htm).
1. (Optional) To view the details for your project immediately after creation, select **Display project details after creation**.
1. Click **Create**.

This creates the project and opens the project page.

You can *proceed to the next lab*.
