# File System Storage Service

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the Cloud Storage (File System Storage) self-paced lab from Oracle!

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage Service provides a durable, scalable, distributed, enterprise-grade network file system. You can connect to a File Storage Service file system from any bare metal, virtual machine, or container instance in your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). You can also access a file system from outside the VCN using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect and Internet Protocol security (IPSec) virtual private network (VPN).

In this lab, you will create and mount File System Storage to a compute instance and verify availability of the File System Storage.

    ![](images/ingress_rules.PNG " ")

10. Click **Add Ingress Rules**

## **Step 2**: Create File System Storage

In this section, we will create File System Storage.

1. Click navigation button to open OCI Services menu. Under **File Storage**, click **File Systems**

2. Click **Create File System**

3. Under **Export Information**, click **Edit Details**. Change **EXPORT PATH** to an easy-to-remember name.
   
   Under **Mount Target Information**, click **Edit Details**. Click **CREATE NEW MOUNT TARGET**, select the VCN you justed created for **VIRTUAL CLOUD NETWORK**. Choose **Public Subnet-YOUR\_VCN\_NAME (Regional)** for **SUBNET**.
   
   Click **Create**

     ![](./../file-storage-service/images/FSS_001.png " ")

     ![](./../file-storage-service/images/FSS_002.png " ")

4. OCI console will show your File System details. Under **Exports** Click your mount target name under **Mount Target**. In Mount Target Details page, note down the IP address.

     ![](./../file-storage-service/images/FSS_003.png " ")

     ![](./../file-storage-service/images/FSS_004.png " ")

We now have a File System Storage created. Next we will create a SSH key pair that will be used to login to a compute instance and mount the file system.

## **Step 3**: Create and Connect to Compute Instance

You are assumed to have generated your SSH Keys.

1. In your OCI console, click the navigation button. Under **Compute**, click **Instances**.

2. Click **Create Instance**. Fill out the dialog box:

     - **NAME**: Enter a name
     - **Image or operating system**: For the image, we recommend using the latest *Oracle Linux* available. Click **Change Image** to see available images' details.

    Click **Show Shape, Network and Storage Options**:
     - **Availability Domain**: Select an availability domain

    Click **Change Shape**:
     - **Instance Type**: Select Virtual Machine
     - **Instance Shape**: Select a VM shape

    Under **Configure networking**:
     - **Virtual Cloud Network Compartment**: Select your compartment
     - **Select a Virtual Cloud Network**: Choose your VCN
     - **Subnet Compartment:** Choose your compartment
     - **Subnet:** Choose the Public Subnet under **Public Subnets**
     - **Use Network Security Groups to Control Traffic** : Leave un-checked
     - **Assign a public IP address**: Check this option

     ![](images/configure_networking.PNG " ")

      - **Boot volume:** Leave the default
      - **Add SSH keys:** Choose **Paste SSH Keys** and paste the Public Key you created and saved earlier.

3. Click **Create**

    *Note: If 'Service limit' error is displayed, choose a different shape from VM.Standard2.1, VM.Standard.E2.1, VM.Standard1.1, VM.Standard.B1.1, or choose a different Availability Domain.*

     ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0011.PNG " ")

4.  Wait for instance to be in **Running** state. Go to the directory where you created you SSH Keys. 
   
   For example, in git-bash, enter command:
    ```
    <copy>cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh</copy>
    ```

5.  Enter **ls** to verify your SSH key (e.g. id\_rsa in Windows) file exists

6.  Enter command
    ```
    <copy>bash</copy>
    ```

    ```
    ssh -i <SSH_Key_Name> opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>
    ```

    *Hint: If 'Permission denied error' is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command. You MUST type the command, do NOT copy and paste ssh command.*

7.  Enter 'yes' when prompted for security message

     ![](images/connect_instance.PNG " ")

8.  Verify opc@COMPUTE\_INSTANCE\_NAME appears on the prompt

## **Step 4**: Mount the File System Storage to Compute Instance

Users of Ubuntu and Linux operating systems (we launched a Oracle Linux instance) can use the command line to connect to a file system and write files. Mount targets serve as file system network access points. After your mount target is assigned an IP address, you can use it to mount the file system. You need to install an NFS client and create a mount point. When you mount the file system, the mount point effectively represents the root directory of the File Storage system, allowing you to write files to the file system from the instance.

1. Click the navigation button, under **File Storage**, click **File Systems**. Click your File System. Under **Exports**, click the mount target name under **Mount Target**. Click Action icon on the right, and select **Mount Commands**. Execute the three commands in Mount Commands in your Cloud shell / Terminal. *If you finish this part, you can skip part 2-4 in this Step.*

    ![](./../file-storage-service/images/FSS_006.png " ")
    ![](images/mount_commands.PNG " ")  
2. After you ssh to your compute instance, enter command:

    ```
    <copy>sudo yum install nfs-utils</copy>
    ```
    (This is just to ensure nfs-utils is installed)


3. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs-data</copy>
    ```
    to create a mount point.

4. Mount the file system, enter command:

    ```
    <copy>bash</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>sudo mount 10.x.x.x:/&lt;EXPORT_PATH_NAME> /mnt/nfs-data</copy>
    ```
    **NOTE:** The 10.x.x.x should be replaced with the IP of File System Storage. EXPORT\_PATH\_NAME should be replaced with Export path name used earlier. (Example: If 10.0.0.3 is the IP of File System Storage, and '/' is the EXPORT\_PATH\_NAME, then **sudo mount 10.0.0.3:/ /mnt/nfs-data**).

5. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>df -h</copy>
    ```
    and
    ```
    <copy>mount | grep /mnt/nfs-data</copy>
    ```
    and verify the mounted File System Storage.

    *Note: You may need to change `nfs-data` to the mount point directory you just created.*

     ![](./../file-storage-service/images/FSS_007.png " ")

     ![](./../file-storage-service/images/FSS_008.png " ")

6. Go to your VCN instance, click **Security Lists** and then **Default Security List for YOUR\_VCN\_NAME**. If you do NOT see any Ingress Rule with *ICMP* as IP Protocal and want to ping the mount point, then you can add an Ingress Rule:

      - Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
      - IP Protocol: ICMP
      - Leave other fields blank

    *Note: If you already had one or multiple ICMP Ingress Rules, you can skip this part.*

7. **Optional Step**. Second compute instance can be created and have the same file system mounted on it, following Step 3 and Step 4.

You have now mounted Enterprise grade File System Storage created in OCI to your compute instance. You can place files in this file system. All other VM instances that have mounted this file system will have access to it.

## **Step 5**: Delete the Resources

In this section, we will delete all the resources we created in this lab.

### Delete File System Storage
1. From OCI Services menu, Click **File Systems**, then click your File System name.

2. Under Exports, click the action icon and select **Delete**, and confirm **Delete**.

     ![](./../file-storage-service/images/FSS_010.png " ")

3. Verify there is no data under **Exports**. It may take some time.

4. Click **File Systems** on the top of the page, click the action icon next to your File System, and click **Delete**.

### Delete Compute Instance

1. From OCI services menu, under **Compute**, click **Instances** 

2. Locate your compute instance, click action icon, and then **Terminate**

     ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0016.PNG " ")

3. Make sure **Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume** is ***checked***, click **Terminate Instance**. Wait for instance to fully terminated

     ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0017.PNG " ")

### Delete VCN

1. From OCI services menu, under **Networking**, click **Virtual Cloud Networks**. A list of all VCNs will appear.

2. Locate your VCN, click Action icon, and then **Terminate**. Click **Terminate All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted
