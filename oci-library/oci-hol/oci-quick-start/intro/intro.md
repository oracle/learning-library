# Introduction

In this lab we will create a compute instance, install httpd server on it, attach block volume to it and install an app on the Block Volume. We will then create a second compute instance using the boot volume of the first compute instance and move the Block Volume to the second compute instance (with the app installed). The goal of the lab is to demonstrate launching VCN, Compute Instance, using Boot volume of compute instance and how easy it is to move additional storage with applications/tools installed between compute instances.

## About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Block Volumes

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Block Volume service lets you dynamically provision and manage block storage volumes. You can create, attach, connect, and move volumes, as well as change volume performance, as needed, to meet your storage, performance, and application requirements. After you attach and connect a volume to an instance, you can use the volume like a regular hard drive. You can also disconnect a volume and attach it to another instance without the loss of data.
