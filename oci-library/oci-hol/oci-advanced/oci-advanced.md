# OCI Advanced (Configuring Virtual Cloud Network Peering)

## Introduction

Local VCN peering is the process of connecting two VCNs in the same region and tenancy so that their resources can communicate using private IP addresses without routing the traffic over the internet or through your on-premises network. Without peering, a given VCN would need an internet gateway and public IP addresses for the instances that need to communicate with another VCN

4. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

    /C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id\_rsa (Private Key)

    /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub (Public Key)

    **NOTE:** id\_rsa.pub will be used to create 
    Compute instance and id\_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

    **HINT:** Enter command 
    ```
    <copy>
    cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
    </copy>
    ```
    and then 
    ```
    <copy>
    ls 
    </copy>
    ```
    to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command:  
    ```
    <copy>
    cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    </copy>
    ```
    , highlight the key and copy

11. Click **Create**.

12. Once the instances are in running state, note down the public and private IP addresses of the two compute instances.

13. Configure **First local peering gateway**. Click **Local Peering gateway** in your VCN details page. Hover over the action icon (3 vertical dots) and Click **Establish Peering Connection**.

    ![](./../oci-advanced/images/OCI_Advanced_005.PNG " ")

14. Fill out the dialog box:

    - SPECIFY THE LOCAL PEERING GATEWAY: Browse below (To browse the list of available gateways)
    - VIRTUAL CLOUD NETWORK COMPARTMENT: Select your compartment
    - VIRTUAL CLOUD NETWORK: Choose the **second VCN** (Gateway1 needs to pair with Gateway2 that is in second VCN)
    - LOCAL PEERING GATEWAY COMPARTMENT: Choose the comprtment
    - UNPEERED PEER GATEWAY: Choose the second peering gateway

    ![](./../oci-advanced/images/OCI_Advanced_006.PNG " ")

15. Verify the Local Peering Gateway shows Status as Peered and Peered information is correct.

    ![](./../oci-advanced/images/OCI_Advanced_007.PNG " ")

16. We now need to configure Route tables and Security Lists for the two VCNs. Navigate to First VCN's details page and click **Route Tables**, then **Default Route table for `<FIRST_VCN_NAME>`**.

17. Click **Add route rule** and add the followig rule

    - Target Type: Select **Local Peering gateway**
    - Destination CIDR Block: Enter 10.10.0.0/24
    - Compartment:  Make sure the correct Compartment is selected: 
    - TARGET LOCAL PEERING GATEWAY: Select the Local peering Gateway of First VCN 

18. Click **Add Route Rule**.

    ![](./../oci-advanced/images/OCI_Advanced_009.PNG " ")

29. Navigate to you VCN details page, Click **Security Lists**, then **Default Security list for <FIRST_VCN_NAME>**. Click **Add Ingress Rule**.

20. Enter the following ingress rule; Ensure to leave STATELESS flag un-checked

    - Source CIDR: 10.10.0.0/24
    - IP Protocol: Select ICMP.
    - Source Port Range: All
    - Destination Port Range: All

    ![](./../oci-advanced/images/OCI_Advanced_008.PNG " ")

21. Click **Add Ingress Rule**. 

22. Repeat the steps for second VCN Route table and security list. Use below data:

    **Second VCN Route table**

    - Target Type: Select **Local Peering gateway**
    - Destination CIDR Block: Enter 10.0.0.0/24
    - Compartment:  Make sure the correct Compartment is selected: 
    - TARGET LOCAL PEERING GATEWAY: Select the Local peering Gateway of second VCN 

    **Second VCN Security list rule** (Navigate to Security List and Click **Add Ingress Rule**.)

23. Enter the following ingress rule; Ensure to leave STATELESS flag un-checked.

    - Source CIDR: 10.0.0.0/24
    - IP Protocol: Select ICMP.
    - Source Port Range: All
    - Destination Port Range: All

**We now have two VCNs with one compute instance in each VCN. These VCNs have been connected using a Local Peering Gateway. Any instance in one VCN can reach an instance in the other VCN. Next we will test the connectivity.**

## Step 3: ssh to compute instance and test VCN peering

1. In git bash window, Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh
    </copy>
    ```

2. Enter **ls** and verify id\_rsa file exists.

3. Enter command 
    ```
    <copy>
    bash
    ssh -i id_rsa opc@PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE
    </copy>
    ```

    **We will ssh to the First compute instance**

    **NOTE:** User name is opc. This will enable port forwarding on local host which is needed to access Grafana dash board later on.

    **HINT:** If 'Permission denied error' is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command.

1. Enter 'Yes' when prompted for security message.

    ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0014.PNG " ")
 
2. Verify opc@`<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME>` appears on the prompt.

3. Enter command:

    ```
    <copy>
    bash
    ping <PRIVATE_IP_OF_SECOND_COMPUTE_INSTANCE>
    </copy>
    ```

    **NOTE:** Use Private IP of the compute instance that you are not connected to.

    **Verify the ping is successful**

    If ping is successful then we have successfuly created VCN peering across two different VCNs.


## Step 4: Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window.

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click **Instances** under **Compute**.

3. Locate compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminat**.

    ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0016.PNG " ")

4. Make sure Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume is checked, Click Terminate Instance. Wait for instance to fully Terminate

    ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0017.PNG " ")

5. Repeat the steps to delete the second compute instance.

6. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will appear.

7. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Delete All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted.

    ![](./../oci-quick-start/images/RESERVEDIP_HOL0018.PNG " ")

8. Repeate the step to delete the seond VCN.
