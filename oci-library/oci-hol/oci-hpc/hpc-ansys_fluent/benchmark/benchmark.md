## **Benchmark Example**

![](images/lemans.png " ")

Performances of STAR-CCM+ are often measured using the LeMans benchmark with 17 and 105 Millions cells. The next graphs are showing how using more nodes impact the runtime, with a scaling really close to 100%. RDMA network, which has not been discussed in this runbook, only start to differentiate versus regular TCP runs if the Cells / Core ratio starts to go down.
