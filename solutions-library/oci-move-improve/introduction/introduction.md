# OCI Move and Improve Workshop

## Introduction
This workshop series is part of *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Third Party Move & Improve* workshop. This series will walk you through the process of migrating an existing eCommerce application from an on-prem environment to being natively deployed within the cloud. It will walk you through how to capture a custom image of this app and deploy it on OCI with necessary infrastructure like Networking, Security Lists and route rules. The workshop will also walk you through the process of making the application highly-avaiworkshople in the case of disaster scenarios by leveraging Oracle's DNS services for traffic steering. Finally, the workshop will leverage PaaS services such as Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC), and Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) in order to show how you can gain even more insight into your application data.

## Appendix:  Workshop Assumptions
*Note:* This workshop is intended to be a comprehensive full cloud showcase. As such, it is assumed a user going through this workshop will be provisioning resources and creating users from scratch. If you decide to use existing infrastructure or resources, be aware and keep note of your namings so resources don't overlap and conflict.

*Note:* Additionally, as much as possible, do not stray away from the naming conventions used for resources in this worshop. You may run into errors if you do.
