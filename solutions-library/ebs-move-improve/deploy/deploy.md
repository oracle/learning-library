# Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager Deployment and Configuration

## Introduction
In this 30 mins lab, we will deploy the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager Compute instance using an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace image and configure Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager.

## Step 1. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

Use the tenancy administrator credentials to sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console.

1. Reference your ``Key-Data.txt`` file and locate the tenancy administrator credentials.

2. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console using the following:

* **User name**: ``Tenancy Admin User``

* **Password**: ``Tenancy Admin Password``

## Step 2. Deploy and Configure Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager

You will now create a Resource Manager Stack that will perform the following tasks:

* Create the resources required to deploy the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager. Here is a list of resources which will be created automatically for you:

    a. A compartment

    b. The EBS Cloud Manager IAM group, user and policies to allow the group to operation on the above compartment

    c. Network resources â€“ including a VCN, an internet gateway, subnets, route tables, security lists, and security rules
    
* Deploy a Compute Instance for running the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager

* Configure Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager to work with your OCI Tenancy

1. In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console navigation menu, under **Solutions and Platform** select **Marketplace** and then click **Applications**.

13. Copy and paste **Private IP, Public IP, Login URL** and **LB Public IP** to your ``Key-Data.txt``. These variables are needed for the remainder of the procedures in this lab.

## Step 3. Log in to Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager

Before login in to the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager web application, you need to add the **hostname** in the Login URL to your local computer hosts file. 

Follow the instructions below to perform this configuration:

Edit the local ``hosts`` file on your laptop and add an entry. 

  **a. For Windows users**
