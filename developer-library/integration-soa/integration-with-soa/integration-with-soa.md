# Oracle SOA Suite

## What is SOA?
SOA, Service Orientated Architecture. It is a style of an enterprise IT design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. A SOA service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. These services are representation of multiple applications that each delivers specific business functions. SOA is also an architectural approach to integration and orchestrating these service. Together, the services perform end to end business flow task. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies
