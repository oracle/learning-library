# Introduction

## About MuShop

MuShop is a cloud-native reference showcase app of several Oracle Cloud services. The app implements an e-commerce site for cat products built as a set of Microservices. The name MuShop leans on the term Microservices: Microservices --> Î¼ --> Mu --> Meow --> MuShop. There are two implementations of MuShop, one is the Basic Deployment which runs entirely on the Oracle Cloud Free Tier. The other one is the Complete Deployment which is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster such as Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE). This workshop will cover the Basic Deployment of MuShop.

Estimated Workshop Time: n minutes
