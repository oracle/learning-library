# Deployment

## Introduction

This lab takes you through deploying the Micronaut application to an OCI VM.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

* Build your application distribution
* Upload the application distribution and wallet to an OCI VM
* Run your application on the OCI VM

## **STEP 1**:  Deploy Micronaut Application to OCI

### Deploy (From Local To VM)

1. Before deploying, ensure the wallet exists on the VM by running the snippet produced by `setup.sh` that looks similar to:

    ```
    # run on local machine to push to VM
    <copy>
    scp -i ~/.ssh/id_oci -r /tmp/wallet opc@[VM IP Address]:/tmp/wallet
    </copy>
    ```

2. Build JAR with:

    ```
    # run on local machine
    <copy>
    ./gradlew assemble
    </copy>
    ```

3. Push JAR to VM with the snippet produced by *setup.sh* that looks similar to this:

    ```
    # run on local machine to push to VM
    <copy>
    scp -i ~/.ssh/id_oci -r build/libs/example-atp-0.1-all.jar opc@[VM IP Address]:/app/application.jar
    </copy>
    ```

4. Push Helidon native image to the VM:

    ```
    # run on local machine to push to VM, from the directory that contains downloaded native image
    <copy>
    scp -i ~/.ssh/id_oci ./helidon-mp-service opc@[VM IP Address]:/app/helidon-mp-service
    </copy>
    ```

5. Run the Helidon application on the VM:

    ```
    # run on VM to start Helidon application
    <copy>
    ./app/helidon-mp-service
    </copy>
    ```

4. To run on the VM, SSH in and run the snippet generated by `setup.sh` that looks similar to this:

    ```
    <copy>
    # run on VM to start Micronaut application
    export MICRONAUT_OCI_DEMO_PASSWORD=[Your atp_wallet_password]
    export TNS_ADMIN=/tmp/wallet
    java -jar /app/application.jar
    </copy>
    ```

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
