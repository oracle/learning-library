# Oracle APEX Hands-On Workshops

## Getting Started

Before attempting any of the workshops listed below you need to determine which environment you are going to utilize. You have the choice of signing up for an "Always Free" service on Oracle Autonomous Database, or signing up for the free, "Development-Only" service on [http:\\apex.oracle.com](http:\\apex.oracle.com). Prerequisites in each workshop will walk you through how to register for a new service.

## Overview

These workshops are based on Oracle APEX 20.1.

## Available Workshops
Each workshop is completely independent and does not rely on any other lab, therefore, you can complete the labs in any order you choose. The labs do not require any prior knowledge of APEX.
