# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools, where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets around to gather information, you'll know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

Estimated Time: 40 minutes

### Objectives

* Obtain a APEX free development environment
* Build your first app through uploading a Spreadsheet
* Improve the Faceted Search page
* Improve the Interactive Report and form pages
* Improve Calendar page
* Link pages

*Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 20.1.*
