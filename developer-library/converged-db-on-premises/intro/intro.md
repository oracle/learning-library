# Introduction

## Before You Begin  
This workshop is broken up into a set of labs. Labs 1-4 are to setup your environment and need to be done for all other labs. The remaining labs are not dependent on each other and you can complete which ever ones you are interested in.

To complete this workshop, you will use a preconfigured Converged Database image available in Oracle's Cloud Marketplace to build your compute instance.  This image comes pre-installed with all the information you need to create your environment.

The Image OCID is below. Please copy it to a notepad, you will need it for later in the "Create Compute Instance" lab.

**Preferred Shell**
We recommend you run this workshop using the **Oracle Cloud Shell**.

## Introduction
Converged databases support all data types and workloads. They can also handle any development paradigm, including Microservices, Events, REST, and SaaS, to name just a few. By integrating data types, and workloads as features within a converged database, you can support mixed workloads and data types using a common language (SQL), and a standard set of APIs. You don't need to manage and maintain multiple systems or worry about having to provide unified security across them.

By eliminating data fragmentation, you also eliminate copy contagion. Application modules or services automatically use a single copy of shared data in a converged database. There are no errors or time delays due to data propagated.

Application code overall becomes more straightforward, as you no longer have to work around the limitations of a single-purpose database or worry about integrating data from multiple sources or propagating data across numerous systems.

You also get synergy across datatypes and workloads. For example, by having support for Machine Learning algorithms and Spatial data in the same database, you can efficiently run predictive analytics on Spatial data. Data-driven app development becomes dramatically more straightforward and faster.

A converged database helps keep things less complicated, which in turn helps reduce the cost of implanting and maintaining your system. It also makes things more reliable.

## The Data Driven Application Challenge
Modern data driven applications usher in a more complexity with different data types (Relational, Document, Spatial, Graph) and workloads (Transactions, Analytics, ML,IOT). These require different database algorithms to solve and the two possible data strategies are Single Purpose best of breed database for each data type and workload OR use a converged database for all data types and workloads.

Once we have a single purpose separate database for spatial, ML, Blockchain, JSON, graph etc. we are actually introducing many variables which inherently increases the complexity.

Single purpose Database would eventually end up doing a lot of custom work, writing more code independently using individual proprietary API's and transaction models. Propagating and transforming all these changes with fragmented data all over the place creates lot more complexity and there is definitely a need to integrate it with a lot of customizations. This Integration is a job that never ends.

The necessary features like security, availability, scalability are just very complex to achieve, as each of them has its own models to be built. Later, to propagate any of the smallest change and integrate its a huge activity.

Availability, scalability, consistency, End to End security etc. are very limited in their areas by weakest of their databases that are implemented. Combining all of them gives worst of weakness. These systems are JUST NO economies of scale.


## Solving the Challenge
Oracle has been doing decades of innovation meeting the needs of mission critical complex systems by doing automation and this journey is continuing with emerging needs and solving real-world challenges like real-time analytics, scale out architecture, zero down time, and defense on cyberattacks. This automation expands to Infrastructure, database, Automated Data center operations and machine learning.

Calendar, messaging, clock, and camera functions are now part of Mobile devices. Similarly, key-value, ML, JSON, Transactional, and Sharding are now features of Converged DB.

The Converged Database architecture approach creates Data synergy and simplicity. Synergy across features makes the whole better than the sum of parts. Oracle Converged Database Supports all Workloads (Traditional, Next Generation) and Datatypes (Structured & Un-Structured )

Converged DB makes it much simpler to develop apps. Just call the SQL to run ML, GRAPH, Spatial, JSON, Blockchain etc.

Oracle converged DB on On-premise or on Oracle Cloud Delivers Union of Best Capabilities for each of data type and Workload.
All those bottlenecks (Data Consistency, Data Security, Availability, Scalability, Cross Site Consistency) of single purpose database are solved in Oracle Converged Database.

All of these capabilities create better and informed decisions by increasing the value of information and reducing the time to business insight.
