# Workshop Introduction and Overview #

## Introduction to Oracle BigData SQL (HIVE) ##


The unprecedented explosion in data that can be made useful to enterprises – from the Internet of Things, to the social streams of global customer bases – has created a tremendous opportunity for businesses. However, with the enormous possibilities of Big Data, there can also be enormous complexity. Integrating Big Data systems to leverage these vast new data resources with existing information estates can be challenging.

Valuable data may be stored in a system separate from where the majority of business-critical operations take place. Moreover, accessing this data may require significant investment in re-developing code for analysis and reporting - delaying access to data as well as reducing the ultimate value of the data to the business.
Oracle Big Data SQL enables organizations to immediately analyze data across Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, NoSQL, object stores and Oracle Database leveraging their existing SQL skills, security policies and applications with extreme performance. From simplifying data science efforts to unlocking data lakes, Big Data SQL makes the benefits of Big Data available to the largest group of end users possible.


The goal for the workshop is to give you an understanding of how Big Data SQL works. Specifically, the focus is on Big Data SQL functional capabilities: how to access data from different sources (hdfs & hive), running queries on these sources.
