# Introduction and Overview

###  Oracle Weblogic 

Oracle WebLogic Server provides a modern development platform for building applications, a runtime platform for high performance and availability, and rich management tooling for efficient and low cost operations.

The WebLogic Server complete implementation of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 8 (Java EE 8) specification provides a standard set of APIs for creating distributed Java applications that can access a wide variety of services, such as databases, messaging services, and connections to external enterprise systems. End-user clients access these applications using web browser clients or Java clients. See Programming Models.

In addition to the Java EE implementation, WebLogic Server enables enterprises to deploy mission-critical applications in a robust, secure, highly available, and scalable environment. These features allow enterprises to configure clusters of WebLogic Server instances to distribute load, and provide extra capacity in case of hardware or other failures. New diagnostic tools allow system administrators to monitor and tune the performance of deployed applications and the WebLogic Server environment itself. You can also configure WebLogic Server to monitor and tune application throughput automatically without human intervention. Extensive security features protect access to services, keep enterprise data secure, and prevent malicious attacks.
