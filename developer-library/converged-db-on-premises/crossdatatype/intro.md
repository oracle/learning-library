# Workshop Introduction and Overview #

## Introduction to Oracle Cross Datatype

JSON_TABLE creates a relational view of JSON data. It maps the result of a JSON data evaluation into relational rows and columns.

The COLUMNS clause evaluates the row source, finds specific JSON values within the row source, and returns those JSON values as SQL values in individual columns of a row of relational data.
