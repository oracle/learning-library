# Introduction

Welcome to the Developing and Deploying a Modern Application in Node.js on MySQL Database Service Workshop. This workshop will build cloud-based microservice database applications using Node.js and the MySQL Database Service.

## Workshop Overview

In the next two hours you will experience a day in the life of Derek McCarthy – a full-stack developer for the fictitious company Alpha Office. Derek has been hired to introduce new best practices to Alpha Office microservices developers. In this workshop you will take on Derek’s persona to build a series of three cloud-based microservices database applications. In doing so, you will leverage the latest and most advanced Oracle and open-source technologies.

As Derek, you will spin up a new Oracle Cloud Developer Instance and build a Serverless application. After initial setup you will automate the import of data from Object Store into MySQL and build a microservice-based Web frontend for managing of your co-workers salaries.

Estimated Workshop Time: 100 minutes
