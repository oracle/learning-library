### About the Product/Technology

**Converged Database**

A converged database is a database that has native support for all modern data types and the latest development paradigms built into one product.

Converged databases support Spatial data for location awareness, JSON for document stores, IoT for device integration, in-memory technologies for real-time analytics, and of course, traditional relational data. By providing support for all of these data types, a Converged Database can run all sorts of workloads from IoT to Blockchain to Analytics and Machine Learning. It can also handle any development paradigm, including Microservices, Events, REST, SaaS, and CI/CD, to name a few.

**Oracle Analytics Server**

Oracle Analytics Server (OAS) is an on-premises self-service visualization and augmented artificial intelligence (AI)analytics platform. It provides a full range of capabilities including AI that quickly surfaces key insights in your datasets, data enrichment features that automatically recommend new elements for analysis, machine learning (ML) capabilities for both traditional and citizen data scientists, and stunning data visualizations for your dashboards with pixel perfect reporting.  Built on a proven and modern technological foundation, it supports the highest workloads and most complex deployments while providing timely insights to users across an enterprise at a low overall total cost of ownership.

Organizations can now modernize their analytics platform by providing easy-to-use interfaces for all users who need to access curated data, self-serve by importing or blending data, perform analysis, or distribute reports securely via mobile, tablet, and all modern browsers.
