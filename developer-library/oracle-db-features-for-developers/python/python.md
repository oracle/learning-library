# Python Programming

## Introduction

PL/SQL is ideal for programming tasks within Oracle Database. Most Oracle professionals, however, aren't confined to working strictly within the database itself.

Python is easy to use but also easy to use well, producing code that is readable and well organized. This way, when you return to a piece of code months after it was written, you can understand it, modify it, and reuse it. Python's clean, elegant syntax is sometimes called "executable pseudocode," for its nearly self-documenting appearance. It is highly object-oriented and makes it easy to learn and follow good programming style, even for those of us without formal training in software engineering. Its smooth learning curve makes it appeal to novices and experts alike.

Python's capabilities span the whole range of software needs; the language's simplicity doesn't imply shallowness or narrowness. You won't run up against gaps in Python's abilities that send you looking for a third language.

Python is open-source, cross-platform, and free of cost. There's no excuse not to give Python a try!
