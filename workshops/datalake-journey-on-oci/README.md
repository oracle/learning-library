# Data Lake Journey on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 
Welcome to the Data Lake Journey on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This workshop will introduce you to the concepts of Big Data Cloud platofrm, Object Storage and Event Hub Cloud Service and walks you through all the steps to get started using the **Data Lake on OCI**. You will provision a new Big Data Cloud (BDC) instance, Event Hub CLoud Service instance, Object Storage, how to store and utilise the data from Object Storage, leveraging Event Hub for streaming Data, perform data analysis on BDC, exploring Zeppelin Notebooks and working with Hive, Spark and SparkSQL.




## Goals

 - Understand the functional and technical concepts of Data Lake on OCI
 - Explore the Oracle Cloud Services on OCI
 - Learn about Big Data Cloud, OCI Object Storage and Event Hub Cloud Service
 - Learn how to perform Data Analysis on Big Data Cloud using different languages such as Python, Shell, PySpark, SparkR
 - Learn how to stream the data using Oracle Event Hub Cloud Service
 - Learn how to get/push the data to Object Storage on OCI
 - Learn how ot work with Zeppelin Notebooks on BDC
 - Learn how to work with Hive, Spark and SparkSQL
 - Understand the workflow while integrating these services togther
