# Getting Started with Autonomous Transaction Processing                                    
</td></tr><table>


This workshop walks you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing**. Provision a database, scale ATP, load data, configure node.js with ATP, configure Java with ATP, working with REST APIs, building microservices on ATP, Configuring OCI CLI, and working with Kubernetes.

## Goals for this workshop

- Provision an ATP Database on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- Configure a secure connection using Oracle SQL Developer
- Scaling an ATP Database
- Loading data into ATP Database
- Configure node.js app with ATP
- Building Microservices on ATP
- Configure OCI-CLI

Optionally, you can also learn how to:, 
- Configure Java with ATP
- Working with REST APIs


# How to Get Your Free Cloud Trial Account

As you have pre-registered, please follow the instructors directions to create and login to your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy.

Your instructor will also give you access to a Windows Terminal Server instance that has Oracle SQLDeveloper, Putty and the OCI CLI pre-installed to save time.

# Workshop Overview

## Before You Begin
**What is an Autonomous Transaction Processing?**

Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing delivers a self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database service that can instantly scale to meet demands of mission critical transaction processing and mixed workload applications.  

Read on to begin your Getting Started journey with Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing.

**You are all set, let's begin!**

## Lab 0: Logon to your Windows Terminal Server environment

Your instructor will give you a username, password and IP address of a Windows Terminal Server environment.

Open the Remote Desktop application on your Windows Desktop (for Mac, you'll need to download an "RDP Client" from the App Store).

Using the IP Address, username and password, logon to your "Virtual Desktop".

**The remainder of the day will be spent inside this environment.**
