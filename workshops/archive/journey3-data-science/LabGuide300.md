# Lab: R and Zeppelin

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to use **R** with the **Zeppelin notebook** of **Oracle Big Data Cloud (BDC)**.  

In particular, this lab will show you how to use R/SparkR functionality within Zeppelin notebooks.  This functionality will allow you to use R to query hive tables and read data directly from the Object Store.  It will also allow you to query R data with Spark SQL and to leverage some of Spark's advanced machine learning algorithms.

## Objectives

- Use R and SparkR with Zeppelin Notebooks

## Required Artifacts

- A running BDCS-CE instance and Storage Cloud Object Store instance, created as per the instructions in the New Data Lake Journey Lab 100.  These instructions included the use of a special "bootstrap.sh" script which setup the BDCS-CE environment for this workshop.
- You completed the tutorials in the New Data Lake Journey Lab 200 Getting to know BDCS-CE
- You completed the Data Science Acceleration Journey Lab 200 Setup R, SparkR, and RStudio Server
