If for some reason that is not the case, follow the first several Steps of Lab 100 to once again view the Developer Cloud Service Console.

- Although you will remain connected to the Oracle Cloud using the user account you were provided, you are to take on the Persona of ***Lisa Jones*** as you perform the following steps.
