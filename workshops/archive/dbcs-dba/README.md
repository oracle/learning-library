# Database Cloud Services Workshop for Classic Compute Services

Welcome to the Oracle Database Cloud Service Workshop.  This particular version is based on Oracle's 'Classic' services, versus Oracle Compute Infrastructure (OCI) services.  These labs will give you a basic understanding of the Oracle Database Cloud Service and many of the capabilities around administration and database management.  Lab 100 will introduce you to DBCS and show you how to create a Cloud Database from an on-premise backup.  Lab 200 will cover various data migration use cases, including pluggable database migration, tablespace migration, and schema migration.  Lab 300 covers some common Database management activities.  Lab 400 show you how to use curl commands to perform various tasks.
