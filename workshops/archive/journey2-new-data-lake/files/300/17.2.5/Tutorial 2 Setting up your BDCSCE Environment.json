This is a command-line utility that simplifies working with the Oracle Storage Cloud Object Store.  The Oracle Object Store supports the industry standard OpenStack Object Storage API.  This OpenStack Object Storage API is known as &ldquo;swift&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;swift&rdquo; command line is written in Python and we will use the pip utility to install it.</p>\n<p>You can find more details about the swift command line tool here: <a href=\"https://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/cli.html\">https://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/cli.html</a></p>\n"}]},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1500466404447_-479600968","id":"20170314-112552_1991191498","dateCreated":"2017-07-19T12:13:24+0000","status":"READY","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:443"},{"title":"Commands to install python swiftclient","text":"%sh\necho \"use pip to install python-swiftclient\"\nsudo pip install python-swiftclient==2.7.0 2>&1\necho \"after swiftclient\"\necho \"testing swiftclient\"\nswift --help\necho \"done\"","dateUpdated":"2017-07-19T12:13:24+0000","config":{"editorSetting":{"editOnDblClick":"false","language":"sh"},"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/sh","title":true,"results":{},"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}},"enabled":true},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1500466404448_-493836678","id":"20170314-112622_622475096","dateCreated":"2017-07-19T12:13:24+0000","status":"READY","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:444"},{"text":"%md\n#Before you continue...\n\nBefore you continue, be sure to run the paragraph above and check the output.
