**Second**, ***Download SQL Developer***
- Your client environment **must have SQL Developer** to attempting the Hands-on-Workshop labs. 
- SQL Developer can be obtained at [SQL Developer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/) 

**Third**, ***Download Data Visualization Desktop (Optional, only required for Lab 300)***
- Your client environment **must have Data Visualization Desktop** to attempting the Hands-on-Workshop labs. 
- Data Visualization Desktop can be obtained at [Data Visualization Desktop](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/oracle-data-visualization/downloads/oracle-data-visualization-desktop-2938957.html)
