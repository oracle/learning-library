# User On-boarding

![](images/1/header.png)

## Introduction

This is the first of several labs that are part of the **Oracle Public Cloud Identity Cloud Service workshop.** This workshop will walk you through the process of onboarding user population in Identity Cloud Service (IDCS).

IDCS supports user on-boarding from on-premise Active Directory, using file upload, REST API, on-premise Oracle Identity Management, or manually from IDCS admin console.

In this lab, you will walk-through the on-boarding process using either Active Directory or File upload. 

_Note: use Active Directory, if you have admin access to an Active Directory environment. Otherwise use File Upload_
