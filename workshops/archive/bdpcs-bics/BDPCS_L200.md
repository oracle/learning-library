# Introduction
This lab will build upon the previous workshop lab by adding a new related dataset into the mix and completion of the final step of processing and publishing your prepared results.  These processes are as easy to complete as the first workshop lab and again by both technical and non-technical users in an independent fashion.

To refresh from the first workshop lab, we are still within the Big Data Preparation process phase, but we are nearing the point where we can transition to analysis and reporting of our prepared and enriched dataset.

Again, the overall goal is to ensure data consistency and thus higher quality analysis results as a self-service activity.

This will be the final data preparation workshop lab before we transition to analyzing our processed dataset this afternoon.

    ![](images/L200/p17.png)

- Step 7: Extract Day of the Week from OrderDate.  Select OrderDate from the Recommendations list.

    ![](images/L200/p18.png)

- From the list of Recommendations, click the checkmark for Extract day\_of\_week from OrderDate to apply this transform.

    ![](images/L200/p19.png)

- This will add a column to the dataset containing the day of the week associated with the respective OrderDate.

    ![](images/L200/p20.png)

- Format OrderDate.  Returning to the list of Recommendations, click the checkmark for Format epoch date in OrderDate as MM/dd/yyyy to apply this transform.  ***Note: An epoch date is a date value using a POSIX/UNIX encoding format.  The number of seconds from January 1, 1970.***

    ![](images/L200/p21.png)

- This will format the data as shown here:

    ![](images/L200/p21.1.png)

## Blending Two Datasets Within a Transform
- Invoke the dataset Blend.  From the main Transform screen, press the Blend button.  This will display the Blending Configuration dialog.

    ![](images/L200/p26.png)


- Configure the blend conditions.
- Click the checkmark next to Use F1.identifier with F2.UserAccount as blend key to accept these fields as our Blending Conditions.
- Click the Right Join radio button to select Right Join as the Output Option.

    **Blending Conditions:**  Blending or joining two datasets in BDPCS requires columns from each dataset that contain matching values.  These are used to stitch or blend the two datasets together in a coherent fashion.  In this particular instance, the identifier column in our first dataset contains values that match the UserAccount column values in the dataset we just added.  BDPCS noticed this column value similarity and has already provided a Recommendation that we use this pair of columns for our Blend Conditions.  We will accept this Recommendation.

    ** Output Options:** In addition to the Blending Conditions, we also need to configure our Output Options.  We have three options to choose from as shown below, but for our purposes, we are focused on customer sales activity, so the most appropriate choice is Right Join.  This will ensure all of our activity records are included while excluding any customers that do not have sales activity.  The join behavior is show via the Output Options graphic.  The Match, Left and Right options correspond to how the datasets are shown in the Blending Conditions.  Here the Customer Accounts information is the left dataset and the right dataset contains our Sales Activity.

    ![](images/L200/p27.png)

- Note that the Blending Conditions are populated after accepting the Recommendations.

    ![](images/L200/p28.png)

- Select the Column Selection tab.  Here we have an opportunity to exclude columns from the blended output dataset.  We will accept the default of all columns selected.
- Press the Submit Button to invoke Blend processing

    ![](images/L200/p29.png)

- This will return you to the Transform page.  Next to the Transform name, note the yellow asterisk indicating that BDPCS is currently processing the dataset Blend request.
- **Note:** Blend processing will take a few minutes.  Please be patient.

    ![](images/L200/p30.png)

## Configure the Blended Dataset transforms
- After Blend processing successfully completes, edit the Transform and select the Blend dataset.

    ![](images/L200/p31.png)

- Move the UserAccount column before the gender column.  Scroll down the list of columns then click and drag the UserAccount column, then drop above the gender column.
