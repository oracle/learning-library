## About

Times are changing and things are getting simpler in the Cloud! At Oracle we have invested in delivering a plethora of new Cloud Services and we want to show you how simple – yet powerful they are. We specifically wanted to focus on low code, high productivity services that can be used in building enterprise grade solutions. We believe the best way to do this is to showcase a real world business solution comprised of these services. You will build the entire solution during the course of this workshop all in a stress-free fun environment. By the end of this workshop you would have created a complete “Quote to Order” solution. This solution will comprise of a mobile application, a process automation workflow, integration with an ERP and creating dashboards for visibility and business KPIs. No expertise or experience required We will have experienced instructors guide you through the tool’s online screens and explain how each service works. There is no expertise required from your side, just bring a laptop with a modern web browser and your mobile phone.

## Objective

Cloud is here to stay but your IT’s center of gravity is your choice. Our goal is to show you how you can mix and match on-premise technologies with tools born in the cloud to achieve a hybrid IT that delivers the best from both worlds.

## Summary
