![](images/200/Picture200-title.png)

Update: February 7, 2018

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **DevOps JCS Pipeline using Oracle Stack Manger workshop**. This workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Java Cloud Service (JCS) project that goes through Infrastructure as Code and deployment of a Struts application.

In the first lab (100), the Project Manager created a new project in the Developer Cloud Service, created and assigned tasks to the developers of this application. In this lab, you will assume the persona of Operations, who will be tasked with creating an Infrastructure as Code pipeline for the provisioning of Alpha Office Java Cloud Service (JCS) environment.

## Create Default Build for Template Upload

### Cloud Stack Overview

**Oracle Cloud Stack Manager** is a feature of Oracle Cloud that allows for the provisioning of multiple services within the Oracle Cloud. In order to build and deploy their applications, businesses often require sophisticated environments that consist of multiple, integrated cloud services. Consider a development environment whose needs include a Java application server along with a relational database. Provisioning each of these services for every member of your development team is time consuming and error prone, regardless of whether youâ€™re using service consoles or REST APIs to provision the services. Oracle Cloud Stack Manager uses templates to provision a group of services (called a stack) and in the correct order.

### **STEP 3:** Create Template Update Build Process

Now that we have the configuration code in our managed GIT repository, we need to create a build process that will be triggered whenever a commit is made to the master branch. This build process will trigger any time the Alpha Office Stack template is modified and upload a new version via PSMcli (PaaS Service Manager command line interface) to the Oracle Cloud.

- On navigation panel, click **Build** to access the build page and click **New Job**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-8.png)

- In the New Job popup enter **Infrastructure Update Template** for the Job Name, and then click **Save**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-9.png)

- You are now placed into the job configuration screen.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-10.png)

- Click the **Source Control** tab. Click **Git** and select **JCSStackAlphaInfrastructure.git** from the drop down.

- Under the **Branches** section, expand the **Advanced Git Settings** and enter `Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template.yaml` in the **Included Regions** field.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-11.png)

- Click the **Triggers** tab. Select **Based on SCM polling schedule**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-15.png)

- Click the **Build Steps** tab. Click **Add Build Step**, and select **InvokePSMcli**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-12.png)

- Enter the following data:

  - **Username**: `<Your User Name>`

  - **Password**: `<Supplied Password>`

  - **Identity Domain**: `<Your Identity Domain>` ***Note***: If you are using a **Trial account** and followed the instructions in the [Trial Account Student Guide](StudentGuide.md), then in place of the Identity Domain, you populate this field with the **Identity Service ID** you recorded.

- **Region**: `<Your Assigned Region>`

- **Output Format**: `JSON`

    ![](images/200/Picture200-12.2.png)

- Next we will add a second build step. Click **Add Build Step** and select **Execute Shell**

    ![](images/200/Picture200-12.4.png)

- Enter the following PSM CLI call for the **Execute Shell Command:**

```bash

- If you want to view the results or debug a failure click on the **Console** link.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-17.png)

### **STEP 4:** Verify Template Upload to Oracle Cloud

- Now we will navigate to the Oracle Stack Manager console to view the newly uploaded template. Return to the tab where your Main Cloud Dashboard window is loaded. If your dashboard Window is not available, simply open a tab and go to cloud.oracle.com, and re-login as previously instructed. Note: for those using a Trial account, this is will be your Standard Identity Cloud Service based account/dashboard.

- Once the Oracle Public Cloud **Dashboard** is displayed, click on the navigation icon ![](images/Menu.png) for the **Java** Cloud Service and select **Open Service Console**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-18.1.png)

- From the Java Cloud Service Dashboard, Click on the far left navigation icon and select **Cloud Stack**

    ![](images/200/Picture200-19.png)

- From this service console you are able to manage and monitor all your **Stacks** and **Templates**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-20.png)

- Click on **Templates**. You should see your newly uploaded template **Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template** along with the default templates supplied by Oracle.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-21.png)

```

![](images/200/Picture200-47.png)

### **STEP 12:** Generate Seure Shell (SSH) Files

- To access an Oracle Cloud Instance such as DBCS and JCS we need to supply the ssh public key at the time of provisioning.  Later we will use the ssh private key to access the newly provisioned DBCS instance.

- Open a terminal windows. For **Windows** users we will be using **Git Bash** that should have been installed during the workshop setup.

- To generate the SSH keys enter the command below. **Note** the keys will be placed in the current directory. If you would like them in a specific directly please first change to that directory location.

```bash
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f labkey
```
- Press **Enter** when prompted for the passpharase

![](images/200/Picture200-46.1.png)

- Next we will copy the public key, labkey.pub, to the JCSStackAlphaInfrastructure project. **Note:** These instructions assume the Eclipe workspace was created under the home directory.

```bash
cp labkey.pub ~/workspace/JCSStackAlphaInfrastructure.git-*/.
```
