![](image/200_IL/Picture200-title.png)

Update: October 19, 2017

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **DevOps JCS Pipeline using Oracle Stack Manger workshop**. This workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Java Cloud Service (JCS) project that goes through Infrastructure as Code and deployment of a Struts application.

In the first lab (100), the Project Manager created a new project in the Developer Cloud Service, created and assigned tasks to the developers of this application. In this lab, you will assume the persona of Operations, who will be tasked with creating an Infrastructure as Code pipeline for the provisioning of Alpha Office Java Cloud Service (JCS) environment.

***To log issues***, click here to go to the [github oracle](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/issues/new) repository issue submission form.

## Objectives

## Create Default Build for Template Upload

**Oracle Cloud Stack Manager** is a feature of Oracle Cloud that allows for the provisioning of multiple services within the Oracle Cloud. In order to build and deploy their applications, businesses often require sophisticated environments that consist of multiple, integrated cloud services. Consider a development environment whose needs include a Java application server along with a relational database. Provisioning each of these services for every member of your development team is time consuming and error prone, regardless of whether youâ€™re using service consoles or REST APIs to provision the services. Oracle Cloud Stack Manager uses templates to provision a group of services (called a stack) and in the correct order.

### **STEP 3:** Create Template Update Build Process

Now that we have the configuration code in our managed GIT repository, we need to create a build process that will be triggered whenever a commit is made to the master branch. This build process will trigger any time the Alpha Office Stack template is modified and upload a new version via PSMcli (PaaS Service Manager command line interface) to the Oracle Cloud.

- On navigation panel, click **Build** to access the build page and click **New Job**.

    ![](image/200_IL/Picture200-8.png)

- In the New Job popup enter **Infrastructure Update Template** for the Job Name, and then click **Save**.

    ![](image/200_IL/Picture200-9.png)

- You are now placed into the job configuration screen.

    ![](image/200_IL/Picture200-10.png)

- Click the **Source Control** tab. Click **Git** and select **JCSStackAlphaInfrastructure.git** from the drop down.

- Under the **Branches** section, expand the **Advanced Git Settings** and enter `Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template.yaml` in the **Included Regions** field.

    ![](image/200_IL/Picture200-11.png)
