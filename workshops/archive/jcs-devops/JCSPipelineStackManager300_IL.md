Update: October 19, 2017

## Introduction

This is the third of several labs that are part of the **DevOps JCS Pipeline using Oracle Stack Manger workshop**. This workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Java Cloud Service (JCS) project that goes through Infrastructure as Code and deployment of a Struts application.

In the first lab (100), the Project Manager created a new project in the Developer Cloud Service, created and assigned tasks to the developers of this application. In this lab, you will assume the persona of Java Developer who will be tasked with making enhancements to the Alpha Office Product Catalog UI.

***To log issues***, click here to go to the [github oracle](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/issues/new) repository issue submission form.

## Objectives
