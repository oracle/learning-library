This workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Java Cloud Service (JCS) project that go through Infrastructure as Code and deployment of Struts application.<br><br>You will take on 3 Personas during the workshop. The Project Manager Persona will create the projects, add tasks and features to be worked on, and assign tasks to developers.  The Project Manager will then start the initial sprint. The Operations persona will develop a new pipeline for deployment of JCS and DBCS environment. The Java Developer persona will develop a new struts based UI to display the product catalog.
