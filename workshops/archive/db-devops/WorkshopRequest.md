- Select DBCS Workshop (Other services such as MySQL CS and Compute are also in this bundle of services), and the particular date you are interested in running the workshop.  Note that you should plan to also schedule the prior day of the workshop as well so you can test the setup prior to running the workshop.

- Complete the details and submit.  Be sure to make ***steven.nichols@oracle.com*** the secondary contact so that the environments will be provisioned properly.  Note this will change as the management of this workshop Workshop is transitioned to GSE.  For now Steve will assist GSE.
