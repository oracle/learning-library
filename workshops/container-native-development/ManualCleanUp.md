# Cleaning Up After the Workshop

## Introduction

Now that you have completed the workshop, you may want to remove the artifacts left behind in your Oracle Cloud trial account. This guide will show you how to remove everything that you created during the workshop. Note that compute instances and load balancers left running in your Oracle Cloud trial account will continue to consume trial credits until they are terminated.
