# Unit 7: Managing and Customizing Interactive Grids

This exercise includes six hands-on-labs.

Labs HOL 7-1 through HOL 7-4 use the Demo Projects application.

Labs HOL 7-5 and HOL 7-6 use the Budget App application.

**HOL 7-1: Customizing the Team Members Interactive Grid**: In this lab, you modify the source query, and customize the Demo Proj Team Members interactive grid.

**HOL 7-2: Customizing the Projects Interactive Grid**: In this lab, as a developer, you modify the source query, create a new column link, and customize the display of the Demo Projects interactive grid.

**HOL 7-3: Customizing the Milestones Interactive Grid**: In this lab, you modify the source query, and customize the Demo Proj Milestones interactive grid.

**HOL 7-4: Customizing the Tasks Interactive Grid**: In this lab, you customize the display of the Demo Proj Tasks interactive grid.

**HOL 7-5: Customizing an Interactive Grid as a Developer**: In this lab, you customize the Project Budget Interactive Grid for your end users.

**HOL 7-6: Customizing an Interactive Grid as an End User**: In this lab, you use and customize the display of your Project Budget Interactive Grid.


## HOL 7-1: Customizing the Team Members Interactive Grid


Developers can modify the SQL source query of an interactive grid. In this lab, you modify the source query of the Demo Proj Team Members interactive grid. Then, you hide columns that you do not want to be displayed in the interactive grid. Finally, you save the default settings of the interactive grid.

1.  Navigate to **App Builder** and run the **Demo Projects** application.

2.  In the navigation menu, select **Demo Proj Team Members**. In the Developer Toolbar, click **Edit Page 2**.

3.  The report shows all of the columns in the table and some of those columns (such as those associated with the image), should not be included in the report. Remove columns from the report by updating the SQL Source for the region. In the Rendering tree, locate the **Demo Proj Team Members** region. Click the **Demo Proj Team Members** region.</br>
    ![1a](images/hol07/image3.png)

4.  In the Property Editor, click **Code Editor**. </br>
    ![1a1](images/hol07/image4.png)

5.  In the Code Editor, replace the existing SQL with copy and paste of the following:

  
          select
      
	      "ID",
	      
	      "USERNAME",
	      
	      "FULL_NAME",
	      
	      "EMAIL",
	      
	      "PROFILE",
	      
	      "CREATED",
	      
	      "CREATED_BY",
	      
	      "UPDATED",
	      
	      "UPDATED_BY"
	      
	      from "DEMO_PROJ_TEAM_MEMBERS"
  

6.  Click **Validate**, to ensure the SQL statement is valid. Click **OK**.
    ![1b](images/hol07/image5.png)

7.  Click **Save**. Then, click **Save and Run Page** to access the runtime application.

8.  Some of the report columns should be included in the report, but not visible by default. That way, if users want to review that information, they can manipulate the Interactive Grid and make the columns visible. To change what columns are displayed in the Interactive Grid by default, you must alter the report in the runtime environment and then save the grid.</br>
    Click **Actions** and select **Columns**.</br>
    ![1c](images/hol07/image6.png)

9.  In the Columns dialog, under Displayed, deselect the check boxes for **Username**, **Created**, **Created By**, **Updated**, and **Updated By**. Then, click **Save**.</br>
    ![1d](images/hol07/image7.png)

10.  The interactive grid now does not display the columns that you deselected in the previous step.
    ![1g](images/hol07/image8.png)

11.  To keep the changes you just made, you must save the report. If you were to log out and log back into the runtime environment, or another user runs the report, then the columns you just removed would be visible again.
    A Primary interactive grid displays to all users. Only the developer who creates an interactive grid can save a new Primary interactive grid, rename it, or delete it.
    Click **Actions** and select **Report &gt; Save**. </br>
    ![1e](images/hol07/image9.png)

12.  The default report is now saved for all users.</br>
    ![1f](images/hol07/image10.png)


## HOL 7-2: Customizing the Projects Interactive Grid


In this lab, you update the report source query and remove the column link defined on the ID column. Then, you customize the interactive grid by hiding the columns that need not be displayed, and creating an aggregation on the Tasks column. You save these customizations for all the users. Navigating back to the page designer, you define a column link on the NAME column.

	      (select count('x')
	      
	      from demo_proj_milestones m
	      
	      where m.project_id = p.id
	      
	      ) milestones,
	      
	      (select count('x')
