## Oracle Application Express: Developing Database Web Applications
## Hands-On-Labs Guide

This series of hands-on labs are part of the course material **Oracle Application Express: Developing Database Web Applications**. The labs are designed to teach you how to build applications using Oracle Application Express. The primary vehicle for teaching is a single use case which is expanded on with each lab.

## Prerequisites

The steps and screenshots in this hands-on-labs use Oracle Application Express 5.1.

To run these hands-on-labs, you need to:

-   Obtain an Oracle Application Express Workspace and a Workspace Administrator /Developer user account. Select the most appropriate option from those listed below to obtain a Workspace:

    -   [apex.oracle.com](http://apex.oracle.com/) - Request a workspace on Oracle's free 'development only' service for evaluating the technology.

    -   [Oracle Database Cloud Service](https://cloud.oracle.com/database) - Request service on the Oracle Database Cloud Service. Once provisioned you will be provided access to your cloud service which includes an Oracle Application Express Workspace.

    -   [Oracle Database 11g Express Edition](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/express-edition/overview/index.html) - Download Oracle XE and install on your laptop or desktop machine and then [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/apex/downloads/index.html) and install the latest Oracle Application Express release.

    -   [Oracle VM Virtual Box](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/databaseappdev-vm-161299.html) - Download Oracle VM Virtual Box and then import the [Database Application Development Appliance](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/databaseappdev-vm-161299.html) which includes Oracle Database 12c, Application Express and a number of labs pre-installed.
