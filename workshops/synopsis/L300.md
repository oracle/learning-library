# Background for Oracle Synopsis

In this lab you will assume the role of Sales Manager Chris Nolan. He needs to travel across all of his regions to help close deals. He needs to know where he needs to focus his time and maximize travel.

He just received Sales spreadsheet from his corporate office.  This is about the only report they generate for him that provides much value.  Unfortunately, every time he receives it, he manually scans through the numbers trying to create reports and charts in Excel that are useful.  
He has just boarded a train on his way to a sales office in one of his territories and has an hour or so to kill. He is going to use his time to try out the Synopsis product, specifically looking for two things:
1)	Focus on Sales & Profit of North America Region 
2)	See who (Sales Rep) needs the most help in which City and for which Customer Segment and Product Category.

- NOTE: If you ever want to get rid of projects you can swipe the project card to the right

### **STEP 4: Select the Data Card**

- Synopsis has now pulled in your spreadsheet and aggregated the data.

  Each Spreadsheet is referenced as a Project. Note that at the top of the Project your Dimensions are showing.  Dimensions represent different ways you can slice your data. At the bottom of your project are your measures.  Measures are numeric values that represent measures such as Profit or Sales.

- You can select different dimensions or measures to see your project graph change.

### **STEP 5: Explore the "+" Sign Options**

- Synopsis allows you to connect to different sources:
  - **OAC:** Connect to OAC instance and access Data Sets and create Data Cards from the same
  - **Lens:** It can read any data (switches on the camera to capture the data) and can create BI Analysis / Charts on that automatically by enabling chart option
