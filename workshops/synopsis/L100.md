# Lab 100: Provisioning and Getting Started

## Lab Introduction

You will assume the role of Sales Manager Chris Nolan. Chris needs to travel across all of his regions to help close deals. He needs to know where to focus his time and maximize his travel.

Oracle Day by Day is a part of OAC - Enterprise Edition Offering. Hence a OAC Account needs to be provisioned to enable using Oracle Day by Day.

This lab walks you through the steps to provision a new Autonomous Analytic Cloud service. Note throughout all the labs you may see small differences between what you see in your accounts and the results of various steps due to cloud product updates. 


## Objectives
-   Learn how to provision an Autonomous Analytic Cloud Service

## Required Artifacts
- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

# Steps
