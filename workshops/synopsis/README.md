# Mobile Analytics Workshop featuring Oracle Day by Day & Synopsis

Welcome to the Oracle Day by Day & Oracle Synopsis Workshop.These labs discuss the features of Mobile Apps in the space of Oracle Analytics Cloud, a use case around Sales Organisation with real business challenges. This workshop provides series of hands on labs that help address questions around Sales Organisation and give you a basic understanding of the Mobile Apps and how it vastly simplifies to draw insights from a set of data without reaching out to the traditional way of analysing using a Desktop/PC.

Lab 100 will introduce you to OAC and show you how to create an Analytics Service. Lab 200 will show how to upload a Data Set to OAC and index a dataset/datamodel of interest and how you can visualize patterns in data and run ad-hoc queries to discover patterns in the data using Oracle Day by Day.
Lab 300 will show how you can visualize patterns in data using a Data Set from your mailbox, using Oracle Synopsis.
