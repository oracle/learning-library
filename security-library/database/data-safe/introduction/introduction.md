# Introduction

## About the Oracle Data Safe Workshop

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using Oracle Data Safe. You register an Autonomous Database with Oracle Data Safe and use that database with the main features in Oracle Data Safe. You learn how to provision audit and alert policies on your database, analyze alerts and audit reports, assess the security of your database configurations and users, and discover and mask sensitive data.

## About Oracle Data Safe


Oracle Data Safe is Oracle’s platform for securing data in databases. As a native Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service, Oracle Data Safe lets you assess the security of your database configurations, find your sensitive data, mask that data in non-production environments, discover the risks associated with database users, and monitor database activity.
