You learn how to provision audit and alert policies on your database, analyze alerts and audit reports, assess the security of your database configurations and users, and discover and mask sensitive data.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours

## About Oracle Data Safe

Oracle Data Safe is Oracle’s platform for securing data in databases. As a native Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service, Oracle Data Safe lets you assess the security of your database configurations, find your sensitive data, mask that data in non-production environments, discover the risks associated with database users, and monitor database activity.
