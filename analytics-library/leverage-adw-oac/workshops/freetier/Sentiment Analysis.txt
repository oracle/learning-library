Daniel, 
the current sentiment analysis node is simplistic (not an ML model), only supports English and is based on a short list of words it’s looking for in the text.
There is a plan to enhance this capability in the future
Thanks

Deepanshu,

Additional point is that any “sentiment analysis” is only one piece of most data-driven problems.  There are other additional input data that should be included to capture the full 360 degree customer view.  OML is good at this.

For example, the Boston Red Sox fan’s sentiment may be negative towards the team or the coach , but if they are a certain age, gender marital status and have been season ticket holders for the past 5 years, have purchased a lot of fan memorabilia, etc., then an OML model that can consider all the data (structured, unstructured, transactional, spatial, “graph”, can make a better prediction and they could be your best target customer .

Visually, depicted in OML’s Data Miner UI, think:

 

Same logic applies using ADW + OML Notebooks but just a bit more “code”.  Hope this helps

Hi Deepanshu,
OML Services includes a capability for sentiment analysis from a REST interface, however OML Services is not GA yet, possibly later this year. 
You could use Oracle Text integrated with OML4SQL/R/Py to perform classification, clustering, and other techniques on text data. Oracle Data Miner also allows you to perform text mining by identifying columns as "text" to process alone or in combination with other structured data in the same table/view. 
Specific to sentiment analysis, you could leverage open source packages from R or Python and use them for scoring via OML4R/Py embedded execution. Some resources that turn up include:

Hi Deepanshu,
The OML team has a microservice for this I believe, Boriana can elaborate.
You can also perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Oracle Text either by training a sentiment classifier or by using the default sentiment dictionary.  Oracle Text is available on ADW and ATP.  
There is a worked example in this learning path.

Let me know if you would like more info.
Thank you,

Subject: Re: OAC sentimental analysis algorithm?
 
If you search the archives of the e-mail list you will find I have described multiple times how the sentiment “analysis” works,….
 
It is based on a 500 english word dictionary lookup with a sentiment score for each word and it does not take into account the order of words so:
 
bloody awful -> would get a score of -6 (both bloody and awful have a sentiment score of -3 each)
bloody brilliant -> would get 1, since bloody has score of -3 and brilliant score of 4, but the  sentence is more positive since bloody is a word used to make the following word stronger in both cases
 
You only get back a sentiment (Negative, Positive or Neutral) based on everything < -1 is negative and everything above +1 is positive but you do not get the actual “score”
 
That means that "bloody awful" is scored as Negative but "bloody brilliant” would be Neutral, since it only gets a score of 1, but it should probably be positive

Do agree.

I know when I was at the STP 2014 and they presented Big Data Discovery they had big (pun intended) plans for using ML to do sentiment analysis, do not know what happened with those.
There is also the Oracle Text functionality in the Database (hopefully soon in ADW/ATP) that has some sentiment capabilities, https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/ccapp/performing-sentiment-analysis-using-oracle-text.html#GUID-12014209-8E70-49A8-BD75-86A9C4D401F6, that is using (if I remember right) Oracle Language Technology (OLT),http://olt.us.oracle.com/, for seem of the parts, but not sure for the sentiments, that can be used in Oracle products
