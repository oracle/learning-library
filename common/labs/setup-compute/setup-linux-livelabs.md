# Setup Network and Compute Instance

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to setup a Oracle Virtual Cloud network (VCN) and a compute instance running a pre-configured Oracle Linux 7 install using Oracle Resource Manager and Terraform.  

### About Terraform and Oracle Cloud Resource Manager
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.  Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.  In this lab, a configuration file has been created for you to build network and compute components.  The compute component you will build creates an image out of Oracle's Cloud Marketplace.  This image is running Oracle Linux 7.

Resource Manager is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service that allows you to automate the process of provisioning your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Using Terraform, Resource Manager helps you install, configure, and manage resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model. To learn more about OCI Resource Manager, watch the video below.

### Oracle Cloud Marketplace

The Oracle Cloud Marketplace is a catalog of solutions that extend Oracle Cloud services.  It offers multiple consumption modes and deployment modes.  In this lab we will be deploying the free Oracle Linux 7 Marketplace image.

Link to Marketplace - https://www.oracle.com/cloud/marketplace/

### Objectives

-   Setup a network and compute instance using the Linux 7 Marketplace image
-   Use Terraform and Resource Manager to complete the setup

    Enter the following information and accept all the defaults

    - **Name**:  Enter your firstname and lastname and the day you were born (DO NOT ENTER ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS HERE, including periods, underscores, exclamation etc, it will mess up the configuration and you will get an error during the apply process)
    
    - **Description**:  Same as above
    
    - **Compartment**:  Select Compartment from Email 2

    Click **Next**.

5.  Now, configure your instance.

    ![](./images/linux-compute-ss.png " ")

    Enter the following information:

    **Display Name For Your Instance:** Enter a display name. This will be the display name for the compute instance you create.  We recommend your name and a set of numbers

    **SSH Public Key**:  Paste the public key you created in the earlier lab *Note: If you used the Oracle Cloud Shell to create your key, make sure you paste the pub file in a notepad, remove any hard returns.  The file should be one line or you will not be able to login to your compute instance*

    **Instance Image OCID:** 
    The image cloud OCI ID for various regions are listed below. This is the unique identifier of the Oracle Linux image you will use to build your instance. These IDs are different cross regions, so make sure you find your corresponding ID for your region (your region was provided in Email 2). If you do not see your region, click [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/images/image/54f930a3-0bf3-4f5d-b573-10eeeb7c7b03/) to access the full list. *NOT all regions are displayed below*

    **Public Subnet ID:** The subnet ID which is the address for the pre-created network was provided in Email 2.  Enter that information here.

    Click **Next**.

6. After confirming the stack information and the variables are correct, click **Create**.

    ![](./images/createstack4.png " ")

7.  Your stack has now been created!  Now to create your environment.  *Note: If you get an error about an invalid DNS label, go back to your Display Name, please do not enter ANY special characters or spaces.  It will fail.*

    ![](./images/stackcreated.png " ")



## STEP 2: Terraform Plan (OPTIONAL)
When using Resource Manager to deploy an environment, execute a Terraform **plan** to verify the configuration.  This is an optional step in this lab.  

1.  [OPTIONAL]Click **Terraform Actions** -> **Plan**, then **Plan** in dialog box to validate your configuration.  This takes about a minute, please be patient. Proceed after the image RMJ (Resource Manager Job) turns green.

    ![](./images/terraformactions.png " ")

    ![](./images/planjob.png " ")

    ![](./images/planjob1.png " ")


## STEP 3: Terraform Apply
When using Resource Manager to deploy an environment, execute a Terraform **plan** and **apply**.  Let's do that now.

1.  At the top of your page, click on **Stack Details**.  Click **Terraform Actions** -> **Apply**, then **Apply** in dialog box.  This will create your instance and install Oracle 19c.
    ![](./images/applyjob1.png " ")

    ![](./images/applyjob2.png " ")

2.  Once this job succeeds, the image RMJ (Resource Manager Job) will turn green, and you will get an apply complete notification from Terraform.  Examine it closely, 1 resource has been added.  Congratulations, your environment is created!  Time to login to your instance to finish the configuration.

    ![](./images/applycomplete.png " ")

*Note: If you fail in this step, you may enter the wrong SSH Public Keys in earlier step. Try to restart from Step 1.*


## STEP 4: Connect to your instance

Choose the environment where you created your SSH Key in the previous lab (Generate SSH Keys)

*Note 1:  If you are using your laptop to connect, you cannot connect while on VPN or in the Oracle office on clear-corporate (choose clear-internet).  This does not apply to the Oracle Cloud Shell.*

*Note 2: The SSH Daemon is disable for up to 5 minutes or so while the instance is processing.  If you are unable to connect and sure you have a valid key, wait a few minutes and try again.*

### Oracle Cloud Shell

1. To re-start the Oracle Cloud shell, go to your Cloud console and click the cloud shell icon to the right of the *Region*.  *Note: Make sure you are in the region you were assigned*

    ![](./images/cloudshell.png " ") 

2.  Go to **Compute** -> **Instances** and select the instance you created (make sure you choose the correct compartment)

    ![](./images/compute_instances.png " ")

3.  On the Instance Details page, find the Public IP Address for your instance.

4.  Enter the command below to login to your instance.    
    ````
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
    ````
5.  When prompted, answer **yes** to continue connecting.

    ![](./images/login_instance.png " ")

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
