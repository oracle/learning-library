# Login to Oracle Cloud - SSWorkshop #

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud is the industry's broadest and most integrated cloud provider, with deployment options ranging from the public cloud to your data center. Oracle Cloud offers best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Oracle DB Product Management runs a Self Service Workshop platform for running select workshops.  

SSWorkshop:  After you sign up on the platform, youâ€™ll get two emails.   Check your spam and junk folders.  You should expect the following emails:
- *Email 1:  Verify Email Request* - this contains the URL to verify that your email is a valid one for this tenancy
- *Email 2: SSWorkshop Account Created* - This contains important information needed to complete your workshop along with your username, password and a link to the lab.
