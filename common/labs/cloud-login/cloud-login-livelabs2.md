# LiveLabs Login

## Introduction

Before you get started, you should have an active *Oracle Account* login and a LiveLabs reservation. If you don't already have a login, follow the next step to request one free of charge.

*Note:* An *Oracle Account* is free and is needed to gain access to oracle publicly accessible content and Oracle Support to name the few.

If you already have a reservation, skip to the next lab to start your workshop by reading through the Introduction!

## Step 0: **Create an Oracle Account**
Creating an Oracle account can be summarized in the following two simple steps.

1. Navigate to [oracle.com](http://www.oracle.com), Click on *View Account*, and Select *Create an Account*
