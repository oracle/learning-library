# Setup Sample Schemas- LiveLabs #

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to install a portion of the Sample Schemas in your database.

## Step 1: Install Sample Data

In this step, you will install a selection of the Oracle Database Sample Schemas.  For more information on these schemas, please review the Schema agreement at the end of this lab.

By completing the instruction below the sample schemas **SH**, **OE**, and **HR** will be installed. These schemas are used in Oracle documentation to show SQL language concepts and other database features. The schemas themselves are documented in Oracle Database Sample Schemas [Oracle Database Sample Schemas](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=COMSC).

1.  Copy the following commands into your terminal. These commands download the files needed to run the lab.

    Note: If you are running in Windows using putty, ensure your Session Timeout is set to greater than 0.

    ````
    <copy>
    cd /home/opc/

    wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/3chG0fCfimn_Dq6kER9r0qOBqjPLfM3I4b3l0EaN2w4/n/c4u03/b/labfiles/o/nfscripts.zip

    unzip nfscripts.zip;

    chmod +x *.sh

    /home/opc/setupNF.sh
    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/step1.1-setupscript1.png " " )

    ![](./images/step1.1-setupscript2.png " " )

2.  Install the Sample Schemas.

    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    . /home/oracle/setupNF_DB.sh
    </copy>
