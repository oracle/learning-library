# Library for OSPA OCI Labs

[OCI Overview Lab](./oci-overview/OCI_Overview_HOL.md)
This lab will introduce you to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service.  We will be creating a virtual cloud network, compute instances, and block storage.  Then we will install and configure Docker containers on the compute instance.   This lab is designed to be a simple introduction to many of the services you will use in the design of a customer solution and to familiarize you with those services.
