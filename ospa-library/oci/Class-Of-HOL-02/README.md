# Lab 2 for Class of SE Event



 Hands on lab to introduce students to the OCI Command Line Interface (CLI).  This lab is an easy introduction to the step in between the web interface, which is simple and easy to work with, however it's not conducive to automatic resource creation.  And the more robust API access where everything can be automated with scripts.  The CLI is a wrapper for the API and this lab will introduce students to the power of scripting and an introduction to infrastructure as code.
