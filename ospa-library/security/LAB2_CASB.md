## Mama Maggy's security monitoring business needs for SaaS and OCI

Shannon Kim, Director/Manager of IT is seeking to improve the security monitoring capabilities across On-Premise and Cloud services.
Security Operation Center is overwhelmed because of the number of alerts receive daily. They are barely able to respond on time and proactively identify a threat.
Security might sound as a stopper for the users, but she needs to introduce a solution that helps both, Line-of-Business and IT to keep the environment safe, available and without introducing radical changes to the user experience.
The organization needs to shift from a reactive to a proactive approach. That's why Mamma Maggy as opts for Oracle CASB Cloud Service. CASB Keeps enterprises secure by automating responses to threats with forensics, incident management, orchestration and remediation through native capabilities as well as integration with existing technologies.
Security evolves to become a business enabler and she knows that the best fit to meet this requirement is Oracle CASB Cloud Service.
Her team is on its way of implementing CASB to monitor SaaS applications and OCI. You as the SOC Manager have to integrate these services with the solution and put them ready to reduce no only the amount of alerts received, but human intervention.



## Module 1:  Logging to CASB Community Tenant

**Who Should Complete This Lab:  All Participants**


*	We are purposefully using our “Community” tenant instead of the tenant associated with the Cloud Account. 
*	The “Community” tenant is a persistent sandbox environment where Oracle employees can try out CASB features.
* Open your browser to the CASB instance: https://preprod.casb.ocp.oc-test.com/
* Login to CASB using the Tenant shared admin account

**NOTE: Tenant User id and Password will be delivered by the instructor**

![CASB Console](./media/casb_login1.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1-1 </p>  

* Click the following in sequence as shown in the image to navigate to the administration dashboard

![CASB Console](./media/casb_login2.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1-2 </p>

*	Add your First, Last and email address (highlighted in yellow). Leave Role as “Tenant Admin” and click “Save”. 

![CASB Console](./media/casb_login3.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1-3 </p>

* You should receive an email within a few minutes.

![CASB Console](./media/casb_login3.png)
<p align="center"> Figure 1-4 </p>

* Now you are CASB Tenant administrator. Use your recently created account to login to Oracle CASB Cloud Service


**Note: Due to environment constraints you might not receive the email. Please proceed with the shared id delivered by the facilitator**


## Module 2:  Create and monitor a sanctioned application

The following hands-on labs assume that you are familiar with Oracle Cloud Platform console navigation, as well as access to Oracle CASB Cloud Service console.
In order to ease the process, we recommend using two separate browsers or windows.
We will enroll third-party services as part of the exercises and it's requires to navigate back and forth between CASB and the vendors' dashboards to complete the lab.

For the purpose of this workshop, you will be using Oracle CASB community tenant which you may use indefinitely for whatever CASB features you’d like to try for yourself.

**NOTE: CASB is a dynamic service that is, by design, constantly in flux. As a result, what you see in the console may not match exactly with the lab screenshots. Screenshots are provided solely for illustrative purposes to help guide you directionally through the CASB console.**

For consistency and for the ease of use-cases implementation, you will use a personal **email account (e.g. Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) to sign-up for your Salesforce developer instance**, and for CASB application registration you will use the following naming convention:

`COSE_location+room_appName_GroupNumber` *(e.g. **COSE_AU1_Salesforce_G1**, **COSE_AU1_Salesforce_G2**)*


Following this name convention will help us to clean up the environment once the lab is completed.

****
## Monitoring SaaS applications
Oracle CASB monitors your sanctioned applications after a simple registration process. This enables you to manage risk events from a centralized platform instead of having to monitor the individual application to remediate security threats. Oracle CASB monitors risk events such as blacklisted IP addresses, anomalous user behavior and unwanted security configurations in the application.
As part of this first part of the module, we will enroll two applications used broadly by our customers base. The main goal of this section of the lab is to guide you through the process of configuring the applications to later integrate them with CASB.


### Add SalesForce as a Sanctioned Application - Who Should Complete This Lab:  1 Participant for group

**Note: The learner signing up for Salesforce must differ from the participant that have requested the SSO access via IDCS on LAB 1**

You’ll now add SalesForce as a sanctioned application for monitoring in Oracle CASB, so this business critical application remains compliant with security standards.

**NOTE: If you have a Salesforce developer account you can move to *Create Salesforce CASB Profile* section.**

* Navigate to [Developer SalesForce](https://developer.salesforce.com/)
    * Click the **Sign-up** button in the top right corner
    * Enter the required information
    * Click **Sign me up**

**Note: You must sign-up with your personal account (e.g. Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook)**

## Module 3:  Create a policy alert and display threats

**Who Should Complete This Lab:  All Participants**

In Oracle CASB you can create application specific to specify the monitoring you want for your sanctioned applications. This adds another layer of customizable security for you. Oracle CASB also has pre-made Managed Policies for the applications to make sure application specific security can be enabled from the beginning.
You will now create a policy in CASB that will trigger an alert every time a user is logged in to SalesForce.

### Create a policy

* Login to your cloud platform account and select Oracle CASB Cloud Service.
* Select Configuration in the Navigation menu to the left 
* Select Policy Management
* Click **New Policy**

![CASB Create new policy](./media/casb_sf_newpolicy.png)

## Module 4:  Oracle CASB Monitoring Oracle Cloud Infrastructure


Oracle CASB has the broadest support of infrastructure as cloud services (IaaS). It enables you to monitor infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Infrastructure Cloud (OCI). With Oracle CASB you can monitor all layers of your IT.
 
To monitor OCI, CASB requires credentials with the appropriate OCI access. This section explains how to complete these steps. To accomplish this you’ll first need to create an account, group and policy within OCI. As a part of those steps you will require a signed RSA key.
 
Once you have the OCI credentials, then you’ll register the OCI tenant within Oracle CASB for monitoring. Please follow the steps below to complete the registration process.

### **DEMO** - Register OCI tenant

**NOTE: due to capacity constraints, Instructor will guide you through the process of registering OCI tenants in CASB. Learners will use this App for the incoming labs**

* First, sign into your cloud account

![](./media/image81.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-1 </p>

  * Click Add user to Group (to the previously created CASB group)
    
  * Select user created previously(**MY_CASB_ACCOUNT**) and click add

 ![](./media/image90.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-9 </p> 

* Now you have to create a new key pair. Ensure that you have a public/private key pair available for use by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) before you prepare and register an OCI instance to be monitored by Oracle CASB Cloud Service.
    
    * In Oracle CASB, select Configuration from the Navigation menu. If the Navigation Menu is not displayed,click the Navigation Menu icon in the upper left corner ![](./media/image2.png)
    
    
    * From the Configuration submenu, select **CASB Key-Pair Management**.
    
    * If the Key generation date is not new enough, according to your organization's security policies, click Create new keys.
    
    * Click Generate new keys.

    * The User public key field is updated with a new key value. ![](./media/image91.png)
  

* Click Copy to Clipboard icon to copy the User public key value to the clipboard. ![](./media/image92.png)


* You can also use the Download icon to download the public key to a file.
![](./media/image93.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-10 </p> 

*  Go to OCI, Click Identity and then Users
    
  * Click on the user we previously created.
    
  * Add a public key we generated to the user
    
  * Click on API Keys
    
  * Click on Add Public Key
  ![](./media/image94.jpeg)
  <p align="center"> Figure 4-11 </p> 

* Copy/Paste the public key from CASB into OCI.
    
    * Include the lines “Begin Public Key” and “End Public Key”
    
    * Click Add

![](./media/image95.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-12 </p> 

###  **DEMO** - Register OCI in CASB to monitor activity

* Open a new tab on your browser and go to the Oracle CASB dashboard

* Select Applications from the Navigation menu in the upper left corner ![](./media/image2.png)

* Click Add/Modify App

* Select OCI and Click Next (bottom right corner of the screen)

  ![](./media/image96.jpeg)
  <p align="center"> Figure 4-13 </p> 

* Enter unique name into the field for your OCI instance. Then click Next

![](./media/image97.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-14 </p> 

* As you can see, you can add three types of OCI instances in Oracle CASB Cloud Service, based on the type of OCI compartment that is monitored:

![](./media/image98.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-15 </p> 

  - **OCI Tenancy** - the root compartment that contains all of your
    organization's compartments and other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    cloud resources. Everything in all compartments and sub-compartments
    is monitored.

  - **Compartment under a registered Tenancy** - a specified compartment
    under a registered OCI tenancy. Only the collection of related
    resources within the specified compartment, which are accessible
    only by certain groups that have been given permission by an
    administrator in your organization, are monitored.

  When you register a compartment inside a tenancy that is already
  registered in Oracle CASB Cloud Service, the compartment inherits
  access credentials from the parent tenancy, so you only have to
  specify the compartment name.

  - **A Standalone Compartment** – an OCI compartment that is accessed
    directly, without first registering the OCI tenancy in Oracle CASB
    Cloud Service. As with a compartment under a registered tenancy,
    only the collection of related resources within the specified
    compartment, which are accessible only by certain groups that have
    been given permission by an administrator in your organization, are
    monitored.

  In our case, we will select the first option.

* Go to OCI

* Copy Tenancy OCID and paste into Tenancy OCID field.

* To get the tenancy OCID from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, go to the Tenancy Details page:

  Open the navigation menu, under Governance and Administration, go to **Administration** and click **Tenancy Details.**
  
  ![](./media/image99.jpeg)
  <p align="center"> Figure 4-16 </p> 
  
  The tenancy OCID is shown under **Tenancy Information**. Click **Copy** to copy it to your clipboard.
  
  ![](./media/image100.jpeg)
  <p align="center"> Figure 4-17 </p> 

* Get the user's OCID in the Console on the page showing the user's details. To get to that page:
    
    * If you're signed in as the user: Open the **User** menu ) in the upper right corner and click **User Settings**. ![](./media/image101.png)
    * If you're an administrator doing this for another user: Open the navigation menu. Under **Governance and Administration**, go to **Identity** and click **Users**. Select the user created from the list (MY_CASB_ACCOUNT).

![](./media/image102.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-18 </p> 

* Now back to the OCI app in Oracle CASB. Ensure all of the fields are populated with the Tenancy OCID and User OCID credentials as shown below:
    
    * Click test credentials. You have to receive the green notification that the direct connection was initiated successfully before the submit button will appear.
    
    * Click **Submit**

![](./media/image103.jpeg)
<p align="center"> Figure 4-19 </p>
