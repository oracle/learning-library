The following figure shows a CDB with four containers: the root, seed, and two PDBs. Each PDB has its own dedicated application. A different PDB administrator manages each PDB. A common user exists across a CDB with a single identity. In this example, common user SYS can manage the root and every PDB. At the physical level, this CDB has a database instance and database files, just as a non-CDB does.
