This image shows the entire SQL Query Scratchpad. Below the page title is the SQL paragraph. It contains all the code pasted from a previous step. Below that is the Report Menu bar which contains a row of buttons for modifying the output report type. Below that are a series of objects which can be dragged and dropped into any of three windows. The objects indicate properties like, year, month, and revenue. They can be placed into categories for Keys, Groups, and Values. Keys currently contains Prod_Category_Desc. Groups is empty. Values currently contains Year Sum. Both of the objects have an 'x' on their right edge which can be clicked to remove the object from a category. Below that is the bar graph. It currently contains a single value, 95976.
