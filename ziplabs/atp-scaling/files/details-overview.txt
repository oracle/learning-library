This image shows the details popup window. There is an "x" all the way to the right to close this window.

The window has three tabs: Overview, Plan Statistics, and Parallel. Overview is selected. Parallel is highlighted with a red rectangle.

Under the tabs is the General section, giving general information and the SQL text that was executed.

Under that are two tiles. The first for Time & Wait Statistics, the other for I/O statistics.
