# Create an API Signing Key and SDK CLI Configuration file
## Before You Begin

This 10-minute lab walks you through the steps to create a API signing key for an Oracle Cloud user account and create a configuration file required to connect a client to Oracle Cloud.

### Background
Any software client you use to connect to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure must be configured with the following information:
* An API Signing Key
* The fingerprint of the public key
* Your tenancy's Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID)
* The OCID of your user account

### What Do You Need?

* An Oracle Cloud paid account or free trial. To sign up for a trial account with $300 in credits for 30 days, click [here](http://oracle.com/cloud/free).
* [Git Bash Shell](https://gitforwindows.org/) (Windows)

## **STEP 1**: Record your tenancy and user OCID

1. Create a note file on your local system to record the following information:

    - Tenancy OCID
    - User OCID
    - API Key Fingerprint
    - API Key Passphrase

2. On your Oracle Cloud account, open up the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of the Console. Choose **Administration > Tenancy Details**.

2. The Tenancy Details page shows information about your cloud account. Copy the Tenancy OCID by clicking on the **Copy** link next to it. Save the value in your note file.

3. In the top-right corner of the Console, open the Profile menu (User menu icon) and then click **User Settings** to view the details.

4. Click Copy beside the (User) OCID save it to your note file.

## **STEP 2**: Generate an API Signing Key

To create a user API key, you will use `openssl` on your local system. If you are using Windows, we recommend the Git Bash Shell.

1. Create a `~/.oci` directory:

    *Note: if you already have a .oci directory, you can skip this step.*

    ```
    <copy>mkdir ~/.oci</copy>
    ```

    ![](images/mkdir-oci.png " ")

2. Generate a private key with the following command. On Windows, you will not see a prompt for a passphrase, but you should use one that you can remember. Be sure to make a note of the passphrase you enter, as you will need it later.

    ```
    <copy>openssl genrsa -out ~/.oci/oci_api_key_private.pem -aes128 -passout stdin 2048</copy>
    ```

    ![](images/create-pem-key.png " ")

3. Confirm that the private key file has been created in the directory you specified using the following command.

    ```
    <copy>ls -l ~/.oci</copy>
    ```

    ![](images/check-pem-key.png " ")

6. Change permissions on the file to ensure that only you can read it.

    ```
    <copy>chmod go-rwx ~/.oci/oci_api_key_private.pem</copy>
    ```
    ![](images/change-permissions.png " ")

7. Generate a public key in the same location as the private key file using the following command. Enter the same passphrase you previously used to encrypt the private key file. *Note: there is no prompt on Windows.*

    ```
    <copy>openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/.oci/oci_api_key_private.pem -out ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem -passin stdin</copy>
    ```

    ![](images/generate-public-key.png " ")

8. Confirm that the public key file has been created in the directory you specified.

    ```
    <copy>ls -l ~/.oci</copy>
    ```

11. Having created the API key pair, upload the public key value to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. In the top-right corner of the Console, open the Profile menu again and then click **User Settings** to view the details.

  ![](images/user-settings.png " ")

12. On the API Keys page, click **Add Public Key**.

  ![](images/add-public-key.png " ")

13. Click **select one** and navigate to your `~/.oci` directory, and select the `oci_api_key_public.pem` file. Click **Add**.

  ![](images/upload-public-key.png " ")

14. Note the fingerprint value, you'll use the fingerprint later.

You may proceed to the next lab.
