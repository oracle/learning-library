# Workshop Introduction and Overview                                    

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using **Oracle Big Data Service (BDS)**.

## What is Oracle Big Data Service?
Oracle Big Data Service is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service designed for a diverse set of big data use cases and workloads. From short-lived clusters used to tackle specific tasks to long-lived clusters that manage large data lakes, Big Data Service scales to meet an organizationâ€™s requirements at a low cost and with the highest levels of security.

* Vertically integrated for Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark using Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub.
* Highly secure and highly available clusters provisioned in minutes.
* Expand on premise Hadoop; deploy test and development to the cloud.
* Any scale using high performance bare metal or cost effective virtual machine (VM) shapes.
* End-to-end data management; use with Autonomous Database, Analytics Cloud, OCI Streaming, OCI Data Catalog, OCI Data Science, and OCI Data Flow.
* Use Oracle SQL to query across Hadoop, Object Stores, Kafka, and NoSQL with Cloud SQL.

## Workshop Objectives
- Prepare for using Oracle Big Data Service (BDS).
- Create a Highly-Available (HA) Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH) Oracle BDS cluster using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console (OCI) and Big Data Service (BDS).
- Add Cloud SQL to the cluster and maintain your cluster.
- Access a BDS utility node using a public IP address.
- Use Cloudera Manager (CM) and Hue to access a Big Data Service (BDS) cluster and add ingress rules to the default security rule that enables you to access both CM and Hue.
- Map the private IP address of the first master node in your cluster to a new public IP address to make this node publicly available on the internet and create a Hadoop Administrator user.
