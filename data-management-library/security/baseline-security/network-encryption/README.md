Oracle Database provides native **data network encryption and integrity** to ensure that data in-motion is secure as it travels across the network.

The purpose of a secure cryptosystem is to convert plaintext data into unintelligible ciphertext based on a key, in such a way that it is very hard (computationally infeasible) to convert ciphertext back into its corresponding plaintext without knowledge of the correct key.

In a symmetric cryptosystem, the same key is used both for encryption and decryption of the same data. Oracle Database provides the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric cryptosystem** for protecting the confidentiality of Oracle Net Services traffic.

Oracle SQL*Net traffic can be encrypted by using:

- **Native Network Encryption**

- **TLS certificate-based encryption**
