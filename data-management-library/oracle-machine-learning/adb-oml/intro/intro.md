# Workshop Introduction and Overview #

## Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning ##

Oracle Machine Learning is a powerful technique for analyzing data, and in this sequence of labs, we will show you how to apply it to the most valuable data in your organization - existing enterprise data in Oracle Database. If you are an Oracle data professional but not a data scientist, this workshop will take you through your first machine learning project from data preparation to a successful deployment of a model integrated into an APEX application.

Watch the video below for an introduction to Oracle Machine Learning and a brief demo.

## Workshop Scenario - Alpha Office

To illustrate this, you are going to work with Alpha Office, a fictitious company that sells high-cost products on installment plans. They have noticed that revenues and margins are down somewhat, and that appears to be because too many customers purchase a product, but then are not able to keep up the payments. They return the product which then has to be sold as used or refurbished.

Alpha Office can purchase credit score information, but they need more than that. They need to be able to include data that predicts the likelihood of a customer being unable to continue payments and “involuntarily churning”. They need to do a better job of approvals to cut down this problem. So for each applicant, they need to determine if they have a suitable credit and payment profile. You are going to use machine learning, and customer data from their data warehouse, to build, train, and deploy a model that will do just that for them.

This is a fictitious example, but it reflects a real-world need. You keep your most valuable data in Oracle Database. But do you get the most value out of that data? Are there business problems that you could help your company to solve with machine learning? After you have completed this lab, you will have some of the core expertise to start applying machine learning to your company’s data and business problems. We wish you lots of success!

We will lead you through all the steps to create an Oracle Cloud trial account, provision the services you need, and do the needed machine learning work. If you have an existing personal or company cloud account you are welcome to use that. Otherwise, the first step (if you haven’t already done so) is to create a free Oracle Cloud trial account, following the link below. You can complete this lab using just the free tier, though feel free to experiment with other services, since the free tier comes with a $300 credit valid for 30 days. As soon as you have an account, login and proceed to Lab 1. (Note that although the sign-up process will ask for a credit card, we will not charge that card unless you decide to upgrade to a paid subscription. So it’s safe to sign up - you won’t get an unexpected bill like with some other cloud vendors).
