# Oracle Machine Learning Github


The Oracle Machine Learning product family enables scalable data science projects. Data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT can achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.

Oracle Machine Learning consists of complementary components supporting scalable machine learning algorithms for in-database and big data environments, notebook technology, SQL and R APIs, and Hadoop/Spark environments. 

With Oracle Machine Learning, Oracle moves the algorithms to the data, processing data where it residesâ€”minimizing or eliminating data movement, achieving scalability, preserving security, and accelerating time-to-model deployment. Oracle delivers parallelized in-database implementations of machine learning algorithms and integration with open source R.
