# Introduction

The labs in this workshop cover an introduction to creating a variety of tables types using an Oracle Database. While the skills you will develop in this lab apply to any SQL database, in this workshop, you will leverage an Oracle Autonomous Database and the power of Oracle Cloud.

## About Oracle Autonomous Database

Like an autonomous car, the Oracle Autonomous Database (Autonomous Database) provides a level of performance and reliability manually managed databases can’t deliver. Compared to a manually managed database, the Autonomous Database is easier to run, costs less, performs better, is more available, and eliminates human error.

The Autonomous database automatically tunes itself using Machine Learning algorithms including automatically creating any indexes needed to accelerate applications.  Users get the ultimate simplicity of a “load and go” architecture in which they can simply load their data and run SQL without worrying about creating and tuning their database access structures.
