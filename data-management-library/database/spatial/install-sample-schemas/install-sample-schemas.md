# Install Sample Schemas for Spatial

## Introduction

### Objectives

-   Prepare the sample schema for spatial. Starting with Oracle Database 12c Release 2, the latest version of the sample schema scripts are available on GitHub. You can refer the doucment at [https://github.com/oracle/db-sample-schemas](https://github.com/oracle/db-sample-schemas).

### Lab Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Lab: Login to Oracle Cloud
* Lab: Generate SSH Key
* Lab: Setup


## Step 1: Download Sample Schemas installation Scripts
1.  Sudo to **oracle** user. Run this command to download the database sample schemas installation scripts. You will download a zip file named **v19.2.zip**.
    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    wget https://github.com/oracle/db-sample-schemas/archive/v19.2.zip
    </copy>
    ````
    <img src="images/image-20200429133037177.png" alt="image-20200429133037177" style="zoom:50%;" />
    
    

2.  Unzip the zip file, and cd to the directory.

    ````
    <copy>
    unzip v19.2.zip
    cd  cd db-sample-schemas-19.2/
    </copy>
    ````
    <img src="images/image-20200429133418845.png" alt="image-20200429133418845" style="zoom:42%;" />

3.  Change all embedded paths to match your working directory. The installation scripts need your current directory embedded in various locations. Use a text editor or the following Perl script to make the changes, replacing occurrences of the token `__SUB__CWD__` with your current working directory.

    ```
    <copy>
    perl -p -i.bak -e 's#__SUB__CWD__#'$(pwd)'#g' *.sql */*.sql */*.dat 
    </copy>
    ```

    <img src="images/image-20200429133949928.png" alt="image-20200429133949928" style="zoom:42%;" />

    
## Step 2: Install the Sample Schemas

1. Before install, let's check the oracle environment

    ````
    <copy>
    . oraenv
    ORCL
    </copy>
    ````

    <img src="images/image-20200429134245301.png" alt="image-20200429134245301" style="zoom:42%;" />

2. You can now install the whole sample schemas. In this spatial lab, we only use the **OE** schema. The **OE** schema depend on **HR** schema. So in the next steps, we will install only the **HR** and **OE** schema.

    Run the following command to install **HR** schema first.

    ````
    <copy>
    sqlplus system/Ora_DB4U@orclpdb @./human_resources/hr_main.sql hr users temp Ora_DB4U ./log localhost:1521/orclpdb
    exit
    </copy>
    ````
     <img src="images/image-20200429135059926.png" alt="image-20200429135059926" style="zoom:42%;" />


Then, install the **OE** schema:

```
<copy>
sqlplus system/Ora_DB4U@orclpdb @./order_entry/oe_main.sql oe users temp hr Ora_DB4U /home/oracle/db-sample-schemas-19.2/order_entry/ ./log v3 localhost:1521/orclpdb
exit
</copy>
```

  <img src="images/image-20200429135420511.png" alt="image-20200429135420511" style="zoom:42%;" />



You may now proceed to the next lab.
