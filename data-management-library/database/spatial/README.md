# Oracle Database Spatial Github

Oracle Spatial and Graph offers the industryâ€™s most comprehensive, advanced database for enterprise spatial applications and high performance, secure graph databases. With Oracle Database 19c, in the cloud and on premises, Spatial and Graph powers applications from GIS and location services to fraud detection, social networks, linked data and knowledge management.

The spatial features of Spatial and Graph include both basic spatial data management and analysis and additional high-end functionality including: spatial aggregates, 3D, LiDAR, geospatial imagery, geocoding, routing, and linear referencing.

Oracle Spatial and Graph is included at no extra cost with all Oracle Database cloud services and on-prem editions. Not all Spatial features are enabled on Autonomous Database as described [here ](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/experienced-database-users.html)under the section Restrictions for Database Features.
