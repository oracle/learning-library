# Introduction

## About the Workshop
Welcome to the Containerized Development with Docker on Autonomous Database workshop. In this workshop, you will create an infrastructure to support deployment of a multi-container Docker application (AlphaOffice) running on the Oracle Database.

### What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.  A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. However, unlike in traditional virtualization with a type 1 or type 2 hypervisor, a Docker container runs on the kernel of the host operating system. Within a Docker container, there is no separate operating system.
