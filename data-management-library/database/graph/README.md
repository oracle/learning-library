# Oracle Database Graph Github

## Oracle as a Graph Database
As part of the Converged Oracle Database, you have a scalable graph database for both RDF (semantic) and Property graphs. 

### Property Graphs
Property graphs have become a useful way to model, manage, query and analyze much of the connected data found in todayâ€™s applications and information systems.  They allow you to represent data based on relationships and connectivity, query data by traversing those connections, and analyze data using algorithms that evaluate the strength of the connections, patterns and anomalies in the graph, the importance of elements in the graph, and other factors.

Oracle Database property graph support consists of graph storage, indexing, and search; a powerful in-memory analyst with 50 built-in, parallel analytic functions; a graph query language and developer APIs. Graph algorithms enable you to explore and discover relationships in social networks, IoT, big data, data warehouses and complex transaction data for applications such as fraud detection in banking, customer 360, and smart manufacturing.

### RDF 
The converged database supports standards based RDF data management and analysis. It provides native support for RDF and OWL, W3C-standards for representing and defining knowledge graphs, semantic data, and SPARQL, a graph query language, enabling comprehensive RDF query, reasoning, and analytics.  

RDF graph leverages features such as triple-level security, Exadata, RAC, compression, partitioning, In-Memory Database, parallel query, and high availability for excellent performance and scalability, for data sets in the trillions of quads.  

RDF graphs create a unified metadata layer for disparate applications that facilitates identification, integration, and discovery.  RDF graphs are central to knowledge management, linked data and social network applications common in the healthcare and life sciences, finance, media and intelligence communities.

## Property Graph Workshops

### Tutorial: Setup a property graph environment in Docker
- [Setup with Docker](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/database/graph/livelabs/)

### Customer 360 analysis 
- [Customer 360 Analysis](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/database/graph/livelabs/)  
Note: This assumes you have completed the setup steps and have an environment up and running with Docker. The use case is included in the workshop accessible from the setup link above.
