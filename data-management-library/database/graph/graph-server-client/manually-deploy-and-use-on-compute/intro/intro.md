#  Introduction                               

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to  deploy, configure, and use the Graph Server and Client package to query, analyze, and visualize graph content stored in a Free Tier Autonomous Database (ADB) instance. You will provision a new free tier ADB instance, load data into it, create a graph, and then query, analyze and visualize the graph.

Estimated Workshop Time: 75 minutes
