# Create and enable a user in SQLDeveloper Web

## Introduction
This lab walks you through the steps to get started with SQL Developer Web. You will learn how to create a user in SQL Developer Web and provide that user the access to SQL Develoepr Web.

### What Do You Need?
* Register cloud account
* Generate SSH Keys

## STEP 1: Create the Customer_360 user

1. Login as the Admin user in SQLDevWeb of the newly cerated ADB Free Tier instance.

  Go to your Cloud Console, click **Autonomous Transaction Processing**. Select the ADB instance **ATP Finance Mart** you created in Lab 3.
    
  ![](../images/select_ATP.png " ")

  In Autonomous Database Details page, click **Service Console**. Make sure your brower allow pop-up windows.

  ![](../../images/ADB_console.png " ")

  Choose Development from the list on the left, then click the **SQL Developer Web**.

  ![ADB Console Development Page](../images/ADB_ConsoleDevTab.png " ")

  Enter `ADMIN` as Username, and the enter the password you set up at Lab 3, Step 2, Section 7.

  Login as the ADMIN user. 

  ![Login as Admin](../images/ADB_SQLDevWebHome.png)

2. Now create the `CUSTOMER_360` user. Enter the following commands into the SQL Worksheet and run it while connected as the Admin user.

  ```
  <copy>
  CREATE USER customer_360 
  IDENTIFIED BY Welcome1_C360 
  DEFAULT TABLESPACE data 
  TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp 
  QUOTA UNLIMITED ON data;  

  GRANT connect, resource TO customer_360;
  </copy>
  ```

  ![](../images/ADB_SDW_CreateUser_C360.png " ")

  *Note: The `IDENTIFIED BY` clause specifies the password (“Welcome1_C360”)*


## STEP 2: Enable SQLDevWeb for Customer_360

  1. Now provide SQLDevWeb access for this user. See the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/sql-developer-web.html#GUID-4B404CE3-C832-4089-B37A-ADE1036C7EEA)
  for details.
    First clear the previous text in the SQL Worksheet. 

    Copy and paste the following text into the SQL Worksheet and run it. 
    ```
    <copy>
    BEGIN
      ORDS_ADMIN.ENABLE_SCHEMA(
        p_enabled => TRUE,
        p_schema => 'CUSTOMER_360',
        p_url_mapping_type => 'BASE_PATH',
        p_url_mapping_pattern => 'c360',
        p_auto_rest_auth => TRUE
      );
      COMMIT;
    END;
    /
    </copy>
    ```

  ![Enable SQLDevWeb for Customer_360](../images/ADB_SDW_EnableLoginFor_C360.png " ")

  The URL for SQLDeveloperWeb for the Customer_360 user will have `c360` in place of `admin` in it.   
  Save the URL for the next step.  

  For details, see the ["Provide SQL Developer Web Access to Database Users"](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/sql-developer-web.html#GUID-4B404CE3-C832-4089-B37A-ADE1036C7EEA) section in the documentation.
