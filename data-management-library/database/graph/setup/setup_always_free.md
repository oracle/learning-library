# Setup a Graph environment with Always Free Tier#

## Introduction
Property graphs have become a useful way to model, manage, query and analyze much of the connected data found in todayâ€™s applications and information systems.  They allow you to represent data based on relationships and connectivity, query data by traversing those connections, and analyze data using algorithms that evaluate the strength of the connections, patterns and anomalies in the graph, the importance of elements in the graph, and other factors.

Oracle Database property graph supports and consists of graph storage, indexing, and search; a powerful in-memory analyst with 50 built-in, parallel analytic functions; a graph query language and developer APIs. Graph algorithms enable you to explore and discover relationships in social networks, IoT, big data, data warehouses and complex transaction data for applications such as fraud detection in banking, customer 360, and smart manufacturing.

## Overview
This workshop shows you how to deploy, configure, and use the Graph Server and Client package to query, analyze, and visualize graph content stored in a Free Tier Autonomous Database (ADB) instance. 

In this workshop you will:
- Provision Free Tier Compute and ADB Shared instances.
- Deploy the Graph Server and Client package on the Linux compute instance you provisioned.
- Create and populate tables in the ADB instance.
- Query, analyze, and visualize that data as graphs.
