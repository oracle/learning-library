# Object Storage

## Introduction
In this lab we will create a bucket in Object Storage to store our JSON files ready to load into the database

Estimated time: 5 minutes, plus some time for the upload, depending on your internet connection speed


## Step 0: Download the data files necessary for the rest of the workship.

The files are available at [https://www.yelp.com/dataset]( https://www.yelp.com/dataset ). Click Download Dataset and agree the license. The dataset is a zip archive of just under 5GB, so may take a while to download on a slow internet conection.

Once downloaded, you can unzip the archive, which will give you 5 JSON files and a PDF file containing the license agreement.
Of those 5 files, we need 3:
- yelp\_academic\_dataset\_business.json
- yelp\_academic\_dataset\_review.json
- yelp\_academic\_dataset\_user.json

In the next step we will upload these files to Oracle Cloud storage

## Step 1: Upload JSON data files to Oracle Cloud storage

1.  Log in to the Oracle Cloud console. Click on the hamburger menu at the top left and choose "Object Storage".

2.  Click on "Create bucket"

    The new bucket can be named "yelp"

    Once the bucket is created, click the 3 dots the right of our new bucket and select "Edit Visibility". Change visibility to "Public" and save changes.

3.  Upload files. Click on the “yelp” bucket to open it and and click on “Upload Objects”.
   
    Drag the review, business and user JSON files to the upload window, and click “Upload Objects”.

Note: there are several GB to upload. The upload process will take a while, depending on the _upload_ speed of your internet connection.

Once the business file is uploaded, we can move onto the next module to start loading it to the database. Alternatively, we can wait until all files have uploaded.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
