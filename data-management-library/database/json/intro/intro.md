# Workshop Introduction and Overview #

## Introduction to JSON in the database ##
Oracle Database 19c fully supports schemaless application development using the JSON data model. This allows for a hybrid development approach: all of the schema flexibility and speedy application development of NoSQL document stores, combined with all of the enterprise-ready features in Oracle Database 19c. 

Developers used to the "document database" model can easily develop applications using Oracle's Simple Oracle Document Access (SODA) which provides a straightford API for manipulating documents and collections of documents. The collections and documents are stored in the Oracle Database, and developers can choose at any time to switch to a SQL query model to enhance all the powerful analytic and reporting tools available in Oracle Database 19c. SQL-JSON allows for relational tables and objects to be transformed into JSON, and for JSON objects to be transformed into relational views.
