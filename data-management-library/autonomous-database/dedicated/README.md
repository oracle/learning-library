# Oracle Autonomous Database Dedicated Github

Oracle's Dedicated Autonomous Database service allows an organization to rethink Database IT, enabling a customizable private database cloud in the public cloud. The dedicated choice makes it possible to deliver a self-service database capability that aligns with organizational structure. Different lines of business or project teams can have complete autonomy in their individual execution while the company itself gets a fleet wide simplified aggregation of overall health, availability and cost management. This separation of Fleet vs Database administration allows simple budgeting controls and resource isolation without getting in the way of the line of business execution. And a dedicated database deployment will support the entire spectrum of needs from simple apps to apps that require the highest governance, consistent performance and operational controls.

## Workshop Overview
These hands-on lab guides provide step-by-step directions to setting up and using your dedicated Autonomous database platform in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 

Lab 1  - Deals with setting up the network, users and groups and requires administrator privileges on your OCI account.
Labs 2 & 3 - Geared towards the fleet administrator role responsible for deploying the autonomous exadata infrastructure and container databases.
Labs 4 and  6 - 12 - Intended for a regular database user, DBA or developer who simply want to spin up an autonomous database in one of the pre-provisioned containers and start building applications.
Lab 13 + - Demonstrate the operational aspects of the service
