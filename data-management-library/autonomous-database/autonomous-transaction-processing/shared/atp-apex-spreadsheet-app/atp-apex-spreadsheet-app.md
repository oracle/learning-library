# Creating an APEX Application from a Spreadsheet for ATP #

## Before You Begin ##
This 15-minute lab walks you through uploading a spreadsheet into an Oracle database table, and then creating an application based on this new table. You will then play with the Interactive Report and improve the attached form. Lastly, you will add a Calendar page and then link it to the existing form page. This lab is written for Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), but may also be completed in Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW).

## Background ##
Rather than trying to email a spreadsheet to gather information from different people, simply use the Oracle Cloud to create an app in minutes, and email the URL. This single source-of-truth, multi-user, secured, scalable app is so much better than having 20 (incomplete) spreadsheets!

### What Do You Need? ###
* Access to an instance of Oracle ATP.
* Complete the lab **Provision ADB**.


## STEP 1: Access Application Express (APEX) ##
1. Sign in to the Oracle Cloud. 
2. Click the menu icon to expand the menu on the left edge of the screen.
