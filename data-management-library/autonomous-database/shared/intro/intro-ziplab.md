## **Introduction to Oracle Autonomous Database** ##

Oracle Autonomous Database is a family of self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing cloud services. It’s the world’s first autonomous database, and it redefines database management by using machine learning and automation to eliminate human labor, human error, and manual tuning, reducing cost and complexity and ensuring higher reliability, security, and more operational efficiency. Autonomous Database supports a complex mix of high-performance transactions, including reporting, batch, Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning in a single database. This simplifies application development and deployment and enables real-time analytics, personalization, and fraud detection.
