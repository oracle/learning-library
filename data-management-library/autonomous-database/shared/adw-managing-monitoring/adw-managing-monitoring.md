# Bonus Lab: Managing and Monitoring Your Autonomous Database Instance using the Cloud Console

## Introduction

This is a bonus lab where you will watch a video demo that shows the capabilities available via the Cloud Console and Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) or Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) Service Console.

You can use the ADW or ATP service console to monitor the performance of your ADW instance. Service console provides dashboards to monitor the real-time and historical CPU and storage utilization, and database activity like the number of running or queued statements. It also provides Real-Time SQL Monitoring to look at current and past long-running SQL statements in your instance and allows you to cancel long-running queries or set thresholds for ADW or ATP to automatically cancel them for you.

### Demo video

The following **ADW Service Console and Monitoring** demo video will walk you through the service console and show you a running workload.
