UPDATE Data: 

```
<copy>sqlplus ggate/ggate@oggoow191</copy>
```
1.	Alter Customer Table: 

```
<copy>ALTER TABLE SOE.CUSTOMERS  ADD (CUSTOMER_NAME VARCHAR2(40) );</copy>
```
2.	Create Table 

```
<copy>CREATE TABLE "SOE"."LOGON_AUDIT" 
       (    "LOGON_ID" NUMBER , 
            "CUSTOMER_ID" NUMBER, 
            "LOGON_DATE" DATE, 
         "HOST" VARCHAR2(40), 
         "GG_GROUP" VARCHAR2(40), 
         "OSUSER" VARCHAR2(40), 
             "DOMAIN" VARCHAR2(40), 
             "BA_IND" VARCHAR2(40), 
             "COMMIT" VARCHAR2(40), 
          "POS" VARCHAR2(40), 
          "RBA" VARCHAR2(40), 
          "TABLENAME" VARCHAR2(40), 
          "OPTYPE" VARCHAR2(40) 
       ) ;</copy>
```
## **STEP 2:** Concatenating the source ‘m‘ columns into target single ‘n’ columns


![](./images/c1.png " ")


1.	Go to Admin Server console for deployment Boston (http://<your ip address>:17001) and edit the parameter of the REPLICAT REP1 with the attributes to pass customer email to SQLEXEC() for execution of stored procedure and mapping it back to the target table. Add the following, after commenting the already existing map statement for CUSTOMERS table with ”–“. 

![](./images/c2.png " ")

```
<copy>MAP oggoow19.SOE.CUSTOMERS, TARGET oggoow191.SOE.CUSTOMERS, keycols(customer_id), & 
SQLEXEC (SPNAME P_MAIL, PARAMS (code_param = CUST_EMAIL)), & 
COLMAP (USEDEFAULTS, CUST_EMAIL = P_MAIL.desc_param,CUSTOMER_NAME 
=@STRCAT(CUST_FIRST_NAME,CUST_LAST_NAME));</copy>
```
![](./images/c2.png " ")

2.	Open the Administration Server of the Target deployment i.e. Boston at http://<your ip address>:17001. When the page is completely open, you should be at a page where you can see Replicat IREP. Please stop and start the IREP process.

![](./images/c3.png " ")

3. Open a terminal window and execute insert_customer below in SQLPLUS to insert data into customer table.


```
<copy>sqlplus ggate/ggate@oggoow19</copy>
```


4.	Execute for insert 

```
<copy>INSERT INTO SOE.CUSTOMERS VALUES(‘12345678’,'LARRY','ELLISON','NY','NEW YORK','5000','LARRY@ORACLE.COM','365','15-OCT- 11','BUSINESS','MUSIC','4-JAN-61','Y','N','2767122','126219999');
commit;</copy>
```
**1 row copied**

5. After the insert transaction on the source table, query target **CUSTOMER** 

```
<copy>sqlplus ggate/ggate@oggoow191</copy>
```

```
<copy>select CUST_FIRST_NAME,CUST_LAST_NAME,CUSTOMER_NAME from SOE.CUSTOMERS where customer_id=12345678;</copy>
```

![](./images/c5.png " ")

exit

## **STEP 3:** Masking the Source Crucial email-id’s into a dummy email in the target

![](./images/c6.png " ")

1. Go to Admin Server console for deployment Boston `http://<your ip address>:17001` and edit the parameter of the REPLICAT IREP with the attributes to pass customer email to SQLEXEC() for execution of stored procedure and mapping it back to the target table.Add the following, after commenting the already existing map statement for CUSTOMERS table with ”–“.

**Replicat Definition**

2. edit the REPLICAT **IREP** and add the following lines

```
<copy>MAP OGGOOW19.SOE.CUSTOMERS, TARGET OGGOOW191.SOE.CUSTOMERS, keycols(customer_id),&
SQLEXEC (SPNAME P_MAIL, PARAMS (code_param = CUST_EMAIL)),&
COLMAP (USEDEFAULTS, CUST_EMAIL=P_MAIL.desc_param,CUSTOMER_NAME=@STRCAT(CUST_FIRST_NAME,&CUST_LAST_NAME));</copy>
```
![](./images/c7.png " ")


3. Open Terminal and SQLPLUS into Target Database (OGGOOW191).Create a required stored procedure under GGATE users. This will be used in the SQLEXEC call in the mapping statement

```
<copy>sqlplus ggate/ggate@oggoow191</copy>
```

```
<copy>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION F_MAIL(CODE_PARAM IN VARCHAR2) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS DESC_PARAM VARCHAR2(100); BEGIN RETURN 'XXXXXXXXX@dummy.com'; END; /;</copy>
```

**Press Enter**

**Function created**

![](./images/c8.png " ")

4. Select F_MAIL and verify results

![](./images/c9.png " ")

```
<copy>select F_MAIL('MADHU') from dual;</copy>
```


```
<copy>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION F_MAIL(CODE_PARAM IN VARCHAR2) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS DESC_PARAM VARCHAR2(100); BEGIN RETURN 'XXXXXXXXX@dummy.com'; END; / </copy>
```
![](./images/c10.png " ")

```
<copy>exit</copy>
```

5. Open the Administration Server of the Target deployment i.e. Boston at http://<your ip address>:17001. When the page is completely open, you should be at a page where you can see Replicat 6. • Open Terminal and SQLPLUS into Source Database (OGGOOW19) and do the transcation on the table CUSTOMER by executing following
   
   ![](./images/c11.png " ")

```
<copy>sqlplus ggate/ggate@oggoow19</copy>
```

6. Open the Terminal and SQLPLUS into Source Database (OGGOOW19) and do the transcation on the table CUSTOMER by executing update_email below


7.	Run the following Query for update

```
<copy>update soe.customers  set CUST_EMAIL='madhu.kumar.s@yahoo.com' where CUSTOMER_ID=12345678;
commit;</copy>
```
8.	Check the Target tables is stored procedure was executed for static masking of the emails. Open Terminal and SQLPLUS into Target Database (OGGOOW191). Excute “select CUST_EMAIL from soe.customers where customer_ID between 562 and 570;” in SQLPLUS

```
<copy>sqlplus ggate/ggate@oggoow191</copy>
```
```
<copy>select CUST_EMAIL from soe.customers where customer_ID between 562 and 570;</copy>
```
   ![](./images/c12.png " ")


## **STEP 4:** Using Environment Variables/Tokens

   ![](./images/c13.png " ")


1.	Go to Admin Server console for deployment Baston (http://localhost:17001) and edit the parameter of the REPLICAT IREP with the attributes to map the Environment Variables to the audit table. Add the following after *useridalias command

2. edit Relicat Settings REPLICAT IREP and add the following lines
   
```
<copy>MAP OGGOOW19.SOE.LOGON, TARGET OGGOOW191.SOE.LOGON_AUDIT, KEYCOLS(LOGON_ID), &
 COLMAP (USEDEFAULTS,&
 host=@GETENV('GGENVIRONMENT','HOSTNAME'),&
 gg_group=@GETENV ('GGENVIRONMENT','GROUPNAME')&
 osuser=@GETENV ('GGENVIRONMENT','OSUSERNAME'),&
 domain=@GETENV ('GGENVIRONMENT','DOMAINNAME'),&
 ba_ind=@GETENV ('GGHEADER','BEFOREAFTERINDICATOR'),&
 commit=@GETENV ('GGHEADER','COMMITTIMESTAMP'),&
 pos=@GETENV ('GGHEADER','LOGPOSITION'),&
 rba=@GETENV ('GGHEADER','LOGRBA'),&
 tablename=@GETENV ('GGHEADER','TABLENAME'),&
 optype=@GETENV ('GGHEADER','OPTYPE'));</copy>
 ```

![](./images/c14.png " ")

3. REPLICAT IREP param file will look like
   
![](./images/c15.png " ")

4. Open the Administration Server of the Target deployment i.e. Boston at http://<your ip address>:17001. When the page is completely open, you should be at a page where you can see **Replicat IREP**. 
   
5. Please stop and start the IREP process

![](./images/c16.png " ")

6. Open the terminal and log into SQLPLUS to do transaction on source DB (OGGOOW19) in table LOGON

```
<copy>sqlplus ggate/ggate@oggoow19</copy>
```


```
<copy>insert into soe.customers values('12345678','Larry','Ellison','NY','New York','5000','LARYY@ORACLE.COM','365','15-Oct-11','Business','Music','4-Jan-61','Y','N','2767122','126219999')</copy>
```
```
<copy>Commit;</copy>
```

**1 row copied**

7. After the insert transaction on the source table, query target **CUSTOMER** 


```
<copy>select CUST_FIRST_NAME,CUST_LAST_NAME,CUSTOMER_NAME from SOE.CUSTOMERS where customer_id=12345678;</copy>
```

8. After the insert transaction on the source table, query target **CUSTOMER** table as below in the terminal.

```
<copy>sqlplus ggate/ggate@oggoow191</copy>
```
```
<copy>select CUST_FIRST_NAME,CUST_LAST_NAME,CUSTOMER_NAME from SOE.CUSTOMERS where customer_id=12345678;</copy>
```
